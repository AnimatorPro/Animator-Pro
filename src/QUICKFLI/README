
Hello -
	this contains the minimal source code needed to play back a FLI file.
We'll soon be setting up a way to get this and some support through
Autodesk, but in the meantime I hope you can figure it out. 

	Right now this compiles with Turbo C and assembles with Microsoft Masm.
I've included .OBJ files in case it's a problem to get Masm.  The only
file you should need to customize is Quickfli.c.  The source code will
look better if you convince your text editor that a tab is the same as
four spaces.  


	Anyways good luck.
