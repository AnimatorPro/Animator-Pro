  34022 3DS        While attempting to use a cel created in AAP as a  75    2TK      2
                   background in 3D Studio the following problems                  
                   occur:                                                          
                                                                                   
                   1.  A cel created in AAP is always considered to                
                   be an animation by 3D Studio.  This means that                  
                   when using an AAP cel as a background the image                 
                   size of the cel must equal the image size being                 
                   rendered.  Otherwise, an error message appears and              
                   3DS does not render.  This occurs even if you get               
                   or clip a single frame cel from AAP.  A cel from                
                   AA 1.0 works fine as a background and will be                   
                   resized by 3DS if necessary.                                    
                                                                                   
                   2.  The first issue leads to this second one.  If               
                   you Cel/Clip a cel while using the 320x200 screen               
                   size in AAP, 3D Studio will not accept the cel as               
                   a background when rendering to a 320x200 image                  
                   size.  The error message says the image sizes must              
                   be equal.  If you Cel/Get a cel under the same                  
                   circumstances, getting the entire screen, the cel               
                   is accepted by 3D Studio.  Clipping must not use                
                   the same amount of image area as when you Get the               
                   entire screen.

                   brings up inadequate error message.

                   This message gives no indication to the user that               
                   the wrong port was configured.  It would be much                
                   more informative for the user, in this situation,               
                   if a message appeared stating that the wrong port               
                   was configured.

                   Flitape with the Targa                                          
                   Plus, using all tmode settings (there are 8                     
                   applicable tmode settings).                                     
                                                                                   
                   2.  A 320x200 image created with Animator 1.0 will              
                   NOT be squashed while                                           
                   using Flitape with the Targa Plus, using all tmode              
                   settings, but will be                                           
                   squashed in Ani Pro when the screen size is set to              
                   640x480 or 800x600                                              
                   (these are the only screen resolutions I have                   
                   available at the time that                                      
                   are greater than 640x400).                                      
                                                                                   
                   3.  A 320x200 or 640x400 flic created in Ani Pro                
                   WILL be squashed while                                          
                   using Flitape with the Targa Plus, using all tmode              
                   settings, and will                                              
                   also be squashed in Ani Pro when the screen size                
                   is set to 640x480 or                                            
                   800x600.                                                        
                                                                                   
                   Jim Kent says the squashing in Ani Pro is a                     
                   hardware problem.  Not all                                      
                   displays have pixels with the same aspect ratios                
                   in all modes.                                                   
                                                                                   
                   I'm wondering why an image created in Animator 1.0              
                   will not be squashed                                            
                   in Flitape, but a 320x200 image from Ani Pro will               
                   be squashed.  Also,                                             
                   both images will be squashed in 640x480 and                     
                   800x600 in Ani Pro.

                   2) Select Pull Ink, draw another box overlapping                
                   the first one, and moving the mouse as you select               
                   the 2nd corner of the box (to create the Pull

                   after selecting No from the previous message.                   
                   However, if the second error message MUST be                    
                   displayed, "...asked for 0" should be changed                   
                   since the user doesn't really "ask for 0".

                   the field while typing.  This causes the user to                
                   be unable to see the characters that are being

                   combination of varying text characters will cause

                   Abnormal Program termination: Page fault. This                  
                   bug was reported to Grant Blaha by Robert                       
                   Churchill of Post Effects.                                      
                                                                                   
                   1) Select Box tool from Home panel.                             
                   2) Enter Optics panel; select Elements/Set Tween.               
                   3) Select Tools button from Tween panel.                        
                   4) Select Poly tool.                                            
                   5) Exit back through panels to the Home panel.                  
                   6) The Poly tool is still highlighted; draw on the              
                   screen.                                                         
                                                                                   
                   Although the Poly tool slot is highlighted, AAP                 
                   still uses the Box tool.  Try steps 1 - 6 with                  
                   various tools and the same effect occurs.                       
                                                                                   
                   7) Now, immediately after doing Steps 5 and 6,                  
                   select Ani/Optics again.                                        
                                                                                   
                   AAP crashes:  "Abnormal program termination: Page               
                   fault" (followed by a code segment address                      
                   location).                                                      
                                                                                   
                   NOTE: The *crash* happened on Donna's and Cindy                 
                   C.'s Compaqs w/DOS 3.31. However, it did not                    
                   occur on John Farey's Compaq  w/ DOS 5.0.
