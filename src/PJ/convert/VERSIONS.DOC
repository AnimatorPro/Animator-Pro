Version notes for CONVERT...

01-20-91  001	Initial version, backup made.

01-27-91  002	Cleaned up Qchoice for Load ST, added support for the new
				facility that allows a PDR to specify options dialogs that
				CONVERT conducts on behalf of the PDR to get output options.
				This supports TIFF and other formats where a picture may be
				stored in several formats or data compression types.

01-30-91  003	Much work towards supporting arbitrary RGB images via loadable
				PDR.  This version taken as a working backup; this is not a
				tested-and-working version.

02-01-91  004	Yay!  The new RGB support now works using loadable PDRs, and
				fully supporting all three rgb load options (load grey, load
				color, and load color with scaling.)  At this point, the color
				processing is still limited to 64-level, with only minor moves
				coded towards supporting 256-level loading and/or scaling.

02-02-91  005 > Fixed a bug that was leaving an image file open after loading
				an image.
			  > The targa pdr is now separate, in \paa\picdrive\targa\, and
				there is no longer any targa-specific code in convert.
			  > The interface to the Pdr options mechanism was changed from
				soft_qchoice() to qchoicef().
			  > A menu selection was added for 'Save Targa'.
