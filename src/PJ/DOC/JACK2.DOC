Here's some new stuff, plus the stuff I forgot to send before...


                         Jack's PJ Notes
                             (12/5)
 
Here are some more PJ notes, questions, bugs 'n stuff:
 
-    The cel rotation angle is not displayed in the status line. 
     (It is in AA.)
 
-    Select Extra/Configure/Input Device/Custom Input Device. 
     What is this?
 
-    Bug:  Here's a bug related to forced menu colors.
 
     -    Start out with a system that does _not_ use the
          burgundy menu colors.
 
     -    Either load a picture that's mostly a single color, or
          ramp the entire 256-color matrix to a black-to-white
          gradient, then draw a large V Grad box on the screen.
 
     -    Clip a copy of the picture to the swap buffer.
 
     -    Change the menu colors to Burgundy.
 
          Result: The burgundy menu colors are forced into the
          last five registers on the palette matrix, and also
          change colors on the screen image.
 
     -    Remove all the menus and the screen image looks fine.
 
     -    Change the menu colors to use the Greys menu.
 
          Result: The old burgandy colors remain in the screen
          image (as well as the matrix), even if you remove the
          menus.  (In other words, the screen image is trashed.)
 
     -    Select Swap/View and the screen colors are restored.
 
-    The Tween screen menus contain two "Reverse" items with
     different functions (Shape/Reverse and Options/Reverse). 
     The Shape/Reverse should be renamed (though I can't think of
     a new term right now
 
-    When entering the Tools or Inks panels from the Flic drop-
     down menu, the associated Ink or Tool slot is disabled in
     the panel.  Why is this?  None of the slots are disabled on
     other panels when entered from the Flic menu.
 
-    The Streak tool should include the brush menu in its options
     box, just like the Draw and Drizzle tools.
 
-    I've been experimenting with the Trails function in the
     Tween screen as a painting technique by tweening from a
     large to a small nested, filled shape.  Most of the inks
     seem to ignore the additive effect.  Only Glaze and Jumble
     seem to increase their effect with each layer.  Is there
     some reason for this?  The Trail function could be extremely
     useful if each layer of ink were additive.
 
-    After selecting Extra/Screen Size, if you cancel, you still
     get the "new screen size" alert.  This alert shouldn't
     appear on a cancellation.
 
-    Is the "new screen size" the same as a New operation?
 
-    Can we get a [+] button on the screen snapshot file save
     box?  This would sure help when putting together
     illustrations.
 
-    Must be about time to delete the Load button from the brush
     menu.
 
-    The Pan action is inconsistent between the Zoom window
     (click-pan, like the rest of the interface) and screen pan
     (drag-pan, unlike anything else in the program).  Can
     anything be done about this, or do we document it as it
     stands?
 
-    On the Palette panel, the toggle action on the [A] and [B]
     cluster buttons is confusing.  A click on the [A] button,
     for example, should only turn on the [A] cluster.  There
     have been a number of times when I click on the [A] button,
     thinking I've turned it on, when I've actually turned it
     off.
 
-    Grid Paste is _very_ slow -- even in 320x200.  Much slower
     than in Animator.  Is this part written in Atari Basic?
 
-    How does the placement, window size, and Zoom size of the
     Zoom window affect the area to be enlarged in Effects/Expand
     X2?
--------------------------

That's it.  More as I find them.
