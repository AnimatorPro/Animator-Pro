The backup batch job:

	 	Backup.bat will give help text if no arguments are given.
      
	USAGE: backup [all] (drive:) [-f (format if a: or b:)] 
	    (all is save all, otherwise changes since date in backdate.bat)

		all is optional and specifies that all files are to be copied
			with no date checks. 

		drive: is required and is the target drive for the backup.

		-f will call format first if the drive is a: or b: it is ignored
			for the others.


	    Backup.bat will attempt to read the file backdate.bat on the  
    target drive and write all changes in the source to the target  
	drive after the date in backdate.bat unless "all" is the first argument 
	to backup and it writes  all the files. if a floppy drive is used 
	backup will ask to format it  if  format is broken out of it will 
	continue.  If backdate does not exist  on   the target drive all 
	files are written out as if the "all" argument was given.  The -f 
	option is used to format the floppy drives -f does not call format 
	on any drives but a: and b:.   

		To write changes to a floppy copy the backdate.bat file from the 
	previous floppy to the new floppy or write the changes to the old 
	floppy  if they will fit. 
	
		A file backup.txt is written to the dated backup directory which 
	is a text file with a small description of what the backup contains.

		Backup will leave the current directory of the target drive as
	the root of where the backup was copied to.

Hello Peter -
	I got a backup system working with pkzip.  The backup time
on my machine was 7:27 (yep, less than ten minutes) and the
restore was 18:37.   This was with objects.
	It makes two zips  - source.zip and obj.zip - in the
directory your fancy date-to-dir thing makes.  I'd make it one,
but pkzip didn't have enough memory that way.
	I made one small  other change - I'm not storing backup.txt
and lastbak.txt except in the root directory.  Cutting this out
ended up saving about a minute on the backup, and we never seem
to use them.
	Look for /usr10/jkent/pjbackup.zip.   It contains one .c
file and a .exe compiled from it under Turbo that doesn't do much
but help build the 'list' file for pkzip.  Then it's got a batchfile
makelst.bat that gets called in place of backdir.bat.  Finally
backup.bat is reworked a bit.
	Backup.bat takes a parameter as to whether to include the
.obj files.  I hope the format parameter still works.  Anyways I
did do one full backup and restore with it, so we know it's
working mainly.
	The result is about 3 1/2 Meg of zip.  We'll be able
to fit lots more on a bernoulli this way too.  I was hoping the
restore would be faster, but I guess we're just asking MS-DOS to
create too many files.  From what I understand there's not much
you can do about this but get a new DOS.
	cheers -
