
menus


menu grouping system:

	o - when a menu is opened it must be attached to a Menugroup. When
		the open_menu() call gets a group * of NULL the menu will be added to 
		the default group group0 on the Wscreen containing the menu's window.

	o - To open a menu and add it to another group a group must be alloc'd
		and the call init_menugroup(Menugroup *mg) must be done on it.
		the pointer to this new group is passed in to open menu and the newly
		open menu is added to that group.  Any number of menus may be opened
		and added to a group.

	o - All menus attached to a group must be closed before the group 
		structure is discarded.

	o - Menu groups are a convienient way of keeping track of bunches of open
		menus for "hiding" and "showing" or closing the whole group etc.

	o - menus in a group are maintained in the order the windows are on the 
		screen.
