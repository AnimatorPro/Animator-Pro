   a 32 level grey scale and a bunch of rainbows.  Below this is
   the code to insure the menus are drawn in visible colors.  (find_colors(void)
   and related routines.).   When menus are on-screen if necessary
   the last five  color registers are co-opted for menu colors.  It'd
   be nice to make this a bit less obtrusive than it is for the artist.
   Most simply squeeze the picture down to < 250 colors. */
