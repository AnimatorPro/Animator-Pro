  34022 3DS        While attempting to use a cel created in AAP as a  75    2TK      2
                   background in 3D Studio the following problems                  
                   occur:                                                          
                                                                                   
                   1.  A cel created in AAP is always considered to                
                   be an animation by 3D Studio.  This means that                  
                   when using an AAP cel as a background the image                 
                   size of the cel must equal the image size being                 
                   rendered.  Otherwise, an error message appears and              
                   3DS does not render.  This occurs even if you get               
                   or clip a single frame cel from AAP.  A cel from                
                   AA 1.0 works fine as a background and will be                   
                   resized by 3DS if necessary.                                    
                                                                                   
                   2.  The first issue leads to this second one.  If               
                   you Cel/Clip a cel while using the 320x200 screen               
                   size in AAP, 3D Studio will not accept the cel as               
                   a background when rendering to a 320x200 image                  
                   size.  The error message says the image sizes must              
                   be equal.  If you Cel/Get a cel under the same                  
                   circumstances, getting the entire screen, the cel               
                   is accepted by 3D Studio.  Clipping must not use                
                   the same amount of image area as when you Get the               
                   entire screen.

                   a trace line of key color.

                   Jim Kent says the squashing in Ani Pro is a                     
                   hardware problem.  Not all                                      
                   displays have pixels with the same aspect ratios

                   I'm wondering why an image created in Animator 1.0              
                   will not be squashed                                            
                   in Flitape, but a 320x200 image from Ani Pro will               
                   be squashed.  Also,                                             
                   both images will be squashed in 640x480 and                     
                   800x600 in Ani Pro.                                             
  30616 INKS       Redo doesn't work correctly with Pull Ink.         Pj45  2TK      2
                                                                                   
                   1) Using Box tool, draw an opaque box (default                  
                   options).                                                       
                   2) Select Pull Ink, draw another box overlapping                
                   the first one, and moving the mouse as you select               
                   the 2nd corner of the box (to create the Pull                   
                   effect.                                                         
                   3) Select Undo, Undo.                                           
                   4) Pull effect is undone, then reappears.                       
                   5) Select Undo, then Redo.                                      
                   6) Pull effect is undone, but is not redone.                    
                   7) To check that it was a problem with Pull Ink                 
                   and not the Box tool, a Redo of Pull Ink was                    
                   attempted with the Draw tool as well, but it                    
                   failed.                                                         
  32221 INKS       Redo doesn't work after using Smear ink.           PJ51  2TK      2
                                                                                   
                   1)  Select Reset from the Flic menu.                            
                   2)  Draw a large HGrad box.                                     
                   3)  Change the brush size to 10.                                
                   4)  Select Smear ink.                                           
                   5)  Hold down the left-mouse button and drag the                
                   cursor through the box several times.                           
                   6)  Click on Undo, then on Redo.                                
                   7)  Notice nothing happens.

                   1) Create 10 frames.                                            
                   2) Load greytile.cel.

                   the field while typing.  This causes the user to                
                   be unable to see the characters that are being

Peter -
    o - 34258 TOOLS A bug quite un-related to the previous bug.  If optics 
        was set to the tween element and NO TWEEN EXISTED this was not handled
        properly.  When I tested it I always made a tween in the tween menu or
        had previously done so so a tween file existed.  The fault was in the
        free_dlist() routine that did not properly check for an unitialized
        list.

Thanks for the update.  With the Summa one I'd help us quite a bit in
diagnosing the problem if you could test it some with the old (real mode
320x200 only) animator.   The code for the summa tablet is about 90%
shared between the two.   If it's what I think it is - the switch in and
out of protected mode being slow enough to drop a couple of characters
on the old slow IBM machines - then it's going to involve a bit of R&D
to fix.   If you get the same thing in the old animator though it'll be
something else, and hopefully easier.

    o - 34929 ANIMCEL Murphy strikes again.  A slip of the editor finger 
        deleted the function that redrew the buttons!  Replaced.
    o - 34925 PALETTE A fix was put in that should correct this.  However
        Since we did not actually prove that is was fixed it may not be.  I was
        unable to reproduce it after the fix was in place.
    o - 35602 PLAYER Somehow this change did not make it into the build 
        for pj80.
    o - 35605 PLAYER I have no fix for any of the control/break related
        bugs.  This is something caused by code internal to the keyboard
        interrupt handler installed by bios.  Other than substituting the
        interrupt handler which would be a messy job and not operate correctly
        on more than one brand of clone, I dont know what to do about this.
    o - 34258 TOOLS A bug quite un-related to the previous bug.  If optics 
        was set to the tween element and NO TWEEN EXISTED this was not handled
        properly.  When I tested it I always made a tween in the tween menu or
        had previously done so so a tween file existed.  The fault was in the
        free_dlist() routine that did not properly check for an unitialized
        list.

QA called me to indicate that the font line spacing (and leading but they
didn't mention it) are not restored as part of the program state.
You know the font thing better than I.  One may add fields to the vsetting
without problem just DONT add any pad and put defualt values into the
globals.  This would also applt ro the current "files" menu setting if it should
be done.

let me know if you want me to look at the font thing.  It seems a little tricky

Oh my, the font line spacing is a little tricky.   Could you put in the
files menu button (it's a static SHORT right now), and I'll look to see how'
you did  it.  (I'm sure it's real straightforward.  Probably so much so I
won't believe it.   I guess the main thing is to recompile a good part of
the world afterward?)
