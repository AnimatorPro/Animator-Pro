Here's some stuff that should go into the readme.

      SUPERVGA.DRV

      The supervga.drv is a display driver which will work with many
      (but not all) super VGA cards.  It is not necessary if you have
      a VESA driver for your card.   To use it take the following steps:
        1. Copy supervga.drv from the ANI\VESA directory into the 
           ANI\RESOURCE directory.   
        2. Start up Animator Pro.
        3. Select Screen Size from the Extra menu.
      If the supervga.drv recognizes your card you will now see some
      extra resolutions available.   Select any of these.

      Due to the diversity of video hardware it is possible that the 
      supervga.drv will not work with your card.   Symptoms of this
      are display problems when you first go to the Screen Size menu
      or after you have selected a display mode from the Screen Size menu.
      If this happens take the following steps:
        1. Reboot your computer.
        2. Delete the file ANI\AA.CFG.
        3. Delete the file ANI\RESOURCE\SUPERVGA.DRV


      BERNOULLI BOXES

      There is an interaction between Animator Pro and the driver for
      IOMEGA's Bernoulli Box which can cause the program to take a minute
      or two to start up.   This happens when you have booted up the machine
      with the Bernoulli Box on,  but then turn the Bernoulli off without
      rebooting the machine.

      SHELLING OUT TO 3D STUDIO

      Generally it is better to quit Animator Pro before starting 3D Studio.
      However if you have a lot of RAM (16 megs recommended) and would like
      to shell out to 3D Studio it is possible using the following procedure:
            1. Run cfig386 on ANI.EXE as follows:
                    cfig386 ani.exe -maxreal FFFFh
               This will restrict the amount of real mode memory Animator Pro
               uses.
            2. When you you ani.exe include a -mem parameter on the command
               line followed by about 1/3 of the memory in your machine.
               For instance on a 16 Meg machine run Animator Pro as follows:
                    ani -mem 5333333
               This will restrict the amount of protected mode memory Animator
               Pro uses.
