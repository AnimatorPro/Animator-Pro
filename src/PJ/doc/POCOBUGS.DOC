ErrCode 	Undefined in the header files.

printf 	 	if the length of the text to be printed is more 
		than a line, "Abnormal Program Termination" occurs.		
Qbusy		The box disappears before the execution of the next
		program line; it does not wait for an input from 
		the user.

Qtext 		Right or left click anywhere on the screen resumes
		the program (instead of a click only on "continue"
		button).
		When the text is long (e.g. more than the size of
		the screen), "continue" button disappears.

Qchoice		When the length of all the buttons is more than
		a line, "Abnormal Program Termination" occurs 
		(Attached: Qchoice.poc).
		When the text is long (e.g. more than the size of 
                the screen),  buttons disappear.
		(Attached: Qchoice1.poc).

Qstring		The length of the input box is shorter, i.e. the
		last character input does not apppear in the box.
		(Attached: Qstring.poc).
		When the text is long (e.g. more than the size of  
                the screen),  button disappears.
		"string" gets assigned although user cancels.

Qmenu		When the number of choices is more than the number
		of elements in the array, either "Abnormal Program 
		Termination" occurs, or garbage apppears for the 
		missing array elements. 
		(Attached: Qmenu.poc)

Qnumber		No error message is given if min > max.
		The slider bar always appears wit min = 0; the
		min is set to the input value only if the user
		clicks on the arrows or the slider bar.
		(Attached: Qnumber.poc)
		While the user selects a number by typing in
		the box under the slider, the function does not 
		check if this number is between min and max, and 
		returns it.

Qlist		When the header is long, its beginning and end are
	 	cut.
		The cursor (vertical line) in the 
		"selected item" box appears on the item if the
		item fills the box entirely. This box can be made
		longer to have the cursor appear after the item.
		(Attached: Qlist.poc, in case of "seven")

Qfile		When the header is long, its beginning and end 
		are  cut.
		It does not give an error message when a button
		other than "load", "save", etc. is passed.
		It does not give a "File not found"  message 
		when a "load", "save", etc. operation is selected 
		on a nonexisting file.
		It does not "load" a .poc file although it exists.
		When "button" is long in length, it overwrites "+".
		It does not check if the suffix begins with a
		period or not and accepts the ones without it.
		(Attached: Qfile.poc)
		
WaitClick	A right-click returns 2, not 1 (in the POCO 
		document it is 1).

PollInput	A right-click returns 2, not 1. No code (0)  is 
		returned when a key is pressed.
		After the user clicks on the "continue" in a
		"Qtext" box, PollInput returns 0 for both
		right and left.	
		(Attached: PollInpu.poc)
		
WaitInput	A right-click returns 2, not 1.		
		



/************** Graphics Library ******************/

It is possible to set colors and RGB to values < 0 and > 255. 




/************** Graphics Modes Library ***********/

GetBrushSize	Returns a number which is one less than
                the  actual size.

SetMaskCreate  	"Create" can be turned on at the same time with
		"Use" - SetMaskUse (this is not allowed in PJ).

Set and GetStarRatio do not apply to rpoly (Poco manual bug).

SetSplineTCB	Sets the value of T to C and B (in TOOLS BOX for
		spline).
		(Attached: SetSplin.poc)

GetSplineTCB    Returns C = B = 0 always.
		(Attached: SetSplin.poc)




/************** Time Oriented Function Library **************/

GetFrame	Returns a frame number which is one less than
                the  actual frame number.

SetFrameCount	count = negative number causes "Abnormal Program
		Termination: Memory Protection Fault".
		count = 0 causes "Abnormal Program Termination:
                Divide Overflow".

PlayFlic	When a negative number is passed, it plays the 
		animation over and over, i.e. in an infinite
		loop.

SetSpeed	does not set the speed correctly. For example,
		SetSpeed(14) sets it to 1,
		SetSpeed(71) sets it to 5, etc.

GetSpeed	does not get the speed correctly - gives a value
		which is approximately 14 times the actual speed.

InsertFrames	"Abnormal Program Termination" occurs for negative
		inputs.

DeleteFrames	When a count > total frame number, or count < 0
		is passed, it does not delete the last frame 
		(deletes others).
		



/*************** Cel Library **************************/

CelGetFrame 	Returns a frame number which is one less than
		the  actual frame number.

		


/*************** Swap Screen Library ******************/

GetPixel	does not return the correct color.
		(Attached: GetPixel.poc)

GetBlock	While allocating memory for the block, it does not
		take the absolute value of width and height, i.e.
		if width or height is negative, it gives 
		"not enough memory message".

SetBlock	Same as GetBlock.




/*************** Optics Library **********************/

OptSetPos	When the denominator q (of the scale factor in
		optPos) is set to 0, "Abnormal Program
		Termination: Divide Overflow" occurs.

OptToFrame	No error message is given when t < 0 or t > 1.

OptToSegment 	Renders all of the transformation, i.e.
		not only the transformation between start
		and stop.




/*************** Misc. Functions Library ***************/

ResizeReset	Does not give an error message for inputs <= 0.

rnd		does not give an error message and returns an
		integer out of range if max < 0.




/*************** Animator File Library  ***************/
		
		
LoadMask	Does not load, gives an E1 error.
		(Attached: LoadMask.poc, mask.msk)

SaveMask	Does not save.
		



/*************** Text Library **********************/


WordWrap	When width and/or height is negative, x and y 
		are no longer the upper left coordinates of
		the box. Since the text starts from (x, y),
		it does not appear in the box in such a case.

GetFontDir 	Returns blank.

P.S. 	I couldn't test DirList, LoadPoe, and RunPoe because
	I don't have enough documentation on these functions,
	and I couldn't create a test case for IconBlit.
	Also I was not able to test OptSetState, and OptGetState
	because the interpreter gave a "not enough buffer"
	message for the following:

	OptState os;
	..
	OptSetState(&os);
	
                                                    Levent
