10/31/90 jk (pj45 release)
FEATURES CHANGES:
	o - Poco calls to user supplied compiled code completely changed.
	    Done with:
			#pragma poco library "somefile.poe"
		instead of the old LoadPoe, RunPoe, FreePoe way.

	o - mask now saved and loaded through save/load_pic().
		if screen size is altered the mask will be truncated like the
		alt. should be scaled along with the alt, but not yet.
	o - Modified  chunk parser to initialize a chunk with options head data
		size before first sub chunk and a DONT_READ_ROOT option for the root
		This code now used for all our "chunked" files.
	o - Pic files now use a "chunked" format with two raster chunk types one
		for bytemaps and one for bitmap masks. and a cmap256 chunk.
		It will still read old picfiles but only writes new ones. Magic
		number is changed.
	o - Scroler code now common to all types of scrollers text and browse.
		based on function draw_1_cel() which can make it any number of things
		blits around cels that are being scrolled instead of re drawing.

		aa.mu put a couple of messages in after comment in aa.mu
	o - Put browse fli info box in aa.mu
	o - Put browse on same path with the text file requestor. It is now 
		prepared to browse cels.
pj44 released

		for pj44
10/23/90 pk 
BUG FIXES:
	o - Fixed bug in invert mask when picture larger than screen, mask
	    bits to right and bottom were not inverted.
	o - Optics panel now doesn't generate spurrious "temp cel restore" error.
	o - Fixed bug in internal mcga card driver that caused crashes by directing
		calls to bym_get(put)_hseg();
	o - Join menu now doesn't destroy old transition frame count when toggling
		into and out of still and cut modes.  The unclipped value is restored
		when going back.  The settings value is set when render or preview is
		selected.
INTERNAL CHANGES:
	o - call to get_path_drive now get_path_device and returns a string.
		as in: "C".
	o - pj_is_fixed() now takes a char * for the device name.
	o - get_devices() now maintains an internal (long) 32 bit array of valid
		devices.
	o - Menu scaling is now automated in open_menu and hang_children no 
		explicit calls are needed other than to set the screen's scale 
		factors.
	o - Paths for file menu are now in array chunk in config file after header
		and only the config file header is in core. calls cfg_get_path() and
		cfg_set_path() are used instead of direct access.

	o - Several more Qchoice texts were moved to aa.mu
	o - There is no more soft_qchoicef() soft_qchoice() now processes
		replaceable arguments when used.
	o - All qchoice calls now return 0 for the first choice, 8 for the last,
		and Err_abort for cancel. and other error codes if an error. All code
		now uses these values.
	o - All Qchoice records in aa.mu are now of class Qchoice.
	o - deleted old menulib.h and menulib.* files
	o - Moved textbox calls to window directory and removed links to vl.screen
		They still use word wrap code which hasn't been broken out.
	o - Modified formatter to give type lists from printf style format strings.
	o - Added a formater call to format new softmenu format replaceable
		argument text strings.  Converted all arguments in aa.mu to this format
	o - Modified soft_continu_box() to use new Ftext softmenu format.
	o - Modified continu_box() yes_no_box() multi_box() etc to take sotfmenu
		ftext format hard coded in program as strings.
	o - Added grc_dto_table() to graphics library to allow tranforming of any

10/21/90 jk (PJ43)
BUG FIXES:
	o - In VRAM driver the text cursor was 1 pixel too short.  (Did
		anyone notice?  Ian's driver tester caught this.)

	o - Palette/cluster/find ramp is fixed.
	o - Fixed a bug with optics/cel element.
FEATURES CHANGES:
	o - Anim Cel moved to top of home/cel pull-down.

10/16/90 jk (&pk integrated released as PJ42)
NEW FEATURE:
	o - #30613 - There's a color cluster on the inks & tools panel.
FEATURES CHANGES:
	o - #30609 - Titling menu has a "Text Files..." button in place
	    of the "Load Text".
	o - #30809 - I made two key equivalents for Anim-Cel/Cel/Lassoo (CO),
	    and Anim-Cel/Cel/Save-Cel (CU),  so that Cel/Load and Cel/Save
		can have the obvious 2-key equiv's.
	o - There's a close box on the file requestor.
	o - In browse/view, you can now view fli's larger than screen.
	o - Changed browse/view to browse/play.  It will now play until
	    a key is hit.  The 'v' key equivalent will switch it to
		view (play once) mode.

BUG FIXES:
	o - PJ resets clock back to 'divide by two' on program exit.
	    This should make people's clocks not get as screwed up by PJ.
	o - Changed prototype in aasyslib.h of strcpy, pj_get_path_suffix,
	    and pj_get_path_name to return char * instead of char.
	o - #30809 - If Pulldown is part of a group that can have
	    asterisks in front,  the key equivalent now works.
	o - #30614 - The Text tool Justify option works.
	o - Text editor stops when it loads a file at <control>Z.  This
		should help it work with some people's word processors which
		like to put <control>Z at the end.
PENDING BUGSS:
	o - Browse/view (or play) trashes screen when it comes
	    back with =MCGA and 8514 drivers.  

10/16/90 pk
FEATURES CHANGES:
	o - join now loads pics in the same manner as loading the cel for the 
		second image source, instead of just flis.
BUG FIXES:
	o - un-reported mask did not work with glass ink and the cel. fixed.
	o - #30820 fixed, cfit table wasn't used in opaqe cel ink with mask.
	o - #30819 fixed a few more clear overlay brackets in auto.c
	o - Un reported, Join menu crashed when transition frames == 1
		Fixed.
	o - Un reported, Join menu displayed wrong frame count on abort requestor
		when in preview mode. Fixed.
INTERNAL CHANGES:
	o - put menus and wndo objects into libraries.
	o - continued work on refining fli library.
	o - wrote module for coding replaceable arguments into the string 
		resource file.
10/09/90 pk (&jk integrating)
FEATURES CHANGES:
	o - Fill box with cel preserves mirror asmuch as possible.  This includes
		any mirroring caused by stretching so that the %scale is < 0
	o - fill fli with cel is like above
	o - A Restore operation is added to the "position" pull down that clears 
		turn,stretch, and mirror to give original cel as clipped.
	o - Unstretch preserves mirroring (stretches < 0) as much as practical
	o - Un mirror operation added. This will remove any stretches that are < 0
	o - Poco loadable library format finished and frozen on the loadable 
		side.  Pj librarys for linking with poco loadables not frozen.
BUG FIXES:
	o - #30816 - fixed
	o - #30815 - NAB.  The cel's position is referenced to the center 
		of the cel when "moving" the cel it is not the position of the cursor 
		that is displayed but the cel's center position. This unless the 
		"move to cursor" option is on the cursor will be the center of the cel.
	o - #30431 - Fixed This is because the settings data was changed and the
		version number was not.  This has been updated and things re compiled.
		Settings will not be able to be read from old settings files or flis.
	o - #30812 Fixed, actually a problem with Un-marqi code for cel, The pixel
		of the cel under the marqui is erased. The actual size of the cel is
		correct as is the size of the marqui. Marqi Now has a separate save
		buffer from the undo screen.
	o - #30817 - Tools in general are not greyed out. Unless the mode is un-
		selectable. Ie: you can select tile ink when there is no cel. Selecting
		a tool mode doesn't do anything until you attempt to use the mouse.
		It is desirable to be able to set up a menu even if all the conditions
		are not met yet.  Like, I wanna paste the frog cel, set paste, get frog
		cel and paste it. OR get frog cel set paste and paste it.  The sprite
		and Tcolor tools are greyed out because selecting them does some set
		up stuff and requires knowledge of the cel. Sprite is also disabled
		if the number of frames in the flic is only 1.
INTERNAL CHANGES:
	o - Renaming a lot of things in the budding "fli.lib" to start with
		pj_ to minimize symbol conflicts for other people.

10/02/90 il (&jk integrated)
NEW FEATURES:
	o - Poco handles enums.
FEATURES CHANGES:
	o - Poco sizeof() operator now deals with expressions inside of parenthesis
		instead of just straight variables.
	o - Poco printf() returns an int now as per ansii.
BUG FIXES:
	o - In poco long comments don't cause a bogus 'line too long' error.
	o - In poco returns before a switch statement no longer cause
	    run-time errors.
10/02/90 pk (&jk integrated)
FEATURES CHANGES:
	o -	Multi menu comes back up after render if render is aborted.
		all other cases return to caller without flashing.
	o - On Quit option, program state is saved before moving temp files from
		ram, and a please wait: Saving program state box appears while doing it.
	o - Join menu state exclusive of paths now stored in settings. Sizes of
	 	wipe elements NOT scaled to screen size but absolute.
	o - put last requestor position in Wscreen and put it in all textboxes,
		qnumber, qchoice, and qstring, to prevent migrating menus.
BUG FIXES:
	o - #30805 fixed as a result of #30807 fix
	o - #30610 fixed.
	o - #30810 NAB mirror actually does a rotate by an angle and a stretch
		to invert the cel the other way. Doing unstretch or unturn will nullify
		the coresponding change made by the mirror operation.
	o - #30804 fixed bug in isin_thecel() code.
	o - #30807 fixed reseek not done if canceled with no action.
	o - fixed bug where preview would no accurately display current frame if
	    changes were made to the current frame and the current frame is frame 0
		did a scrub_cur_frame() before preview. adds a kerchunk but corrects
		problem.
	o - #30612 fixed ink[0] change now changes cel tcolor as well as ink[0]
	o - #30429 fixed all pentools now return error code which is reported
		cel tile ink init_cashe() return Err_abort if cel isn't present
		items that call _redo still dont report errors.
10/01/90 jk  (released to Carey Clutts as PJ 39)
BUG FIXES:
	o - #25770 (the tween end integrety bug) is now fixed when tween is
	    an optics element as well as in tween menu.  This involved
		changing a large portion of the optics code.  (I couldn't take
		a shortcut I took in aa1.01 I'm afraid.)  I'm crossing my fingers,
		but you should probably put optics through another good round of
		testing.
	o - #30426 If an error  happens when you change temp  drive paths,
		the new path  isn't kept.   (We _are_ insisting that there
		be a backslash after the device-colon part of the path, because
		otherwise which directory this actually refers to will potentially
		vary from session to session.)
	o - #30430.  This wasn't really a bug.  On the other hand it isn't
		much fun either.  Basically the GIF compression really _does_ take
		a long time at high resolutions.  In fact it was a little slow
		for my taste even in low res.  Oh well.  Anyways we've done
		two things.  1) Put up a box saying Please wait, saving XXX.gif
					 2) Sped up the GIF save (but not enough.)
INTERNAL CHANGES:
	o - Made it so set_colors() and uncc64() and uncc256() in driver
		are  only called  for  on-screen raster.
	o - renamed pj_run_poco to execute_poco and
				pj_fli_create to flic_create
		in preparation for prefacing  all  library functions with pj_.
		(These were the only things currently that start with pj_.)

09/30/90 pk (integrating with jim)
FEATURES CHANGES:
	o - In case not documented in the join.. menu a right click on the vertical
	    bars or horizontal bars brings up a "slat" width slider and displays 
		size on screen.
	o - Right click on boxilate brings up width and then height sliders that
	    display boxil size on the screen.
	o - Added and tested boxilate "wipe" in join menu.
	o - Finished "dissolve" wipe in join menu. Made dot pattern exactly match
		dot pattern from old animator 1.0.
INTERNAL CHANGES:
	o - Sped up generic generic mask2blit by 3 times or so by 
		replacing GET_DOT loop with a PUT_HSEG and a ram loop for unshifting
		masks. (used in boxilate wipe)
BUG FIXES:
	o - fixed bug in copy_in_file() responsible for flx table expansion bugs.
		(This fixes a lot of bugs that involved creating more than 256 frames.
		Specifically 30400, 30607).
	o - fixed bug where frame slider in time menu didn't update zoom when
		incrementing forward by one frame.
	o - (30427) fixed major bug in cel menu, render sequence failed if started 
		from other than first frame and any sprite images overlap. 

09/30/90 jk
INTERNAL CHANGES:
	o - Provide stdiolib to display drivers so the poor fools can debug
	    them.
	o - Made it so that display driver 'close_raster' function doesn't
		get called on every driver when you go to screen menu.

NEW FEATURES:
	o - In Poco have SetAbort(Boolean abort).  If the argument 
		to SetAbort is FALSE, Poco will thereafter not abort
		if a key is hit or right click  recorded.   If the argument is
		TRUE (and if SetAbort is not called) key hits and right clicks
		will abort Poco.
	o - In Poco have HideCursor(),  ShowCursor() which will
		disable/enable cursor display when asking for  input.
	o - Added Qcolor() which brings up a mini color requestor.
	o - Added GetAspectRatio(int *x, int *y); to Poco.
FEATURES CHANGES:
	o - The tools button in the inks  panel when called from optics
		now reads "optics" instead of "ado mouse".

09/27/90 pk	(uploaded changes to jim & jim integrated)
FEATURES CHANGES:
	o - Carried fli locking through. If flis are locked pjs with other user
	 	id codes will not read flis without error code.
	o - moved configuration struct to aaconfig.h changed name to AA_config
		from Config
BUG FIXES:
	o - Clip cel now gets boundary accurately.  Had a "-" where there should 
		have been a "+".
	o - #25778 reproduced and fixed. celt_dot did not work when tcolor was off.

09/27/90 jk
NEW FEATURE:
	o - Have .PCX file handling now.  Right click  over  picture in the
	    files panel...

09/25/90 pk (&jk integrated.  Released as PJ37)
FEATURES CHANGES:
	o - added diamond wipe button and code in join menu
	o - deleted file flilibsq.c from root it is now in \paa\fli
	o - Fli library now will write out old 320 X 200 animator 1.0 flis
	o - Fill box with anim-cel/cel/stretch now hides menus.
	o - Extras/configure/lock FLI is a new option.  Not fully implemented
		yet.  (Will make it so only your copy of PJ will load a FLI.)
BUG FIXES
	o - #25792 - ado cel now ignores x and y offset of screen since screen is
				always centered on itself. Default center is now always center
				of screen. offset only applied to cels.
	o - #30800 - cel temp file flush wasn't updating id to match image file
	o - #30801 - cel temp file flush wasn't updating id to match image file
	o - #30802 - NAB, the cel is freed when clipping is initiated, if aborted 
				from the time menu it will be preserved.
	o - #25778 - cant reproduce. However this is the only ink I know of that 
				actually draws "under" only appearing in tcolor areas. Should 
				this be  disabled?:
	o - #30409 - save_undo_brush() now looks at brush dimensions instead
				of hard coded 16 by 16 brush.
	o - #25754 - partial fix BUT dos_set_drive() returns error on floppies.
				(0 and 1) so it still doesn't work.
	o - #25782 - debug boxes in gif.c in picdrive directory removed.
	o - #25756 - marqui cut now redraws coordinate window even if cursor isnt
				over penwndo so position check is done whenever mouse moves.
9/25/90 jk
	o - #30417 - mask items in mask menu grey out when mask buffer is
	    empty.
	o - #25754 - Put in extra layer around dos_set_drive to compensate
	    for Phar Lap returning a spurious error when changing to
		floppies (or at least to A:).  Now A: button on file selector
		works better.
	o - In Poco, repeated calls to Qmenu() don't result in the menu
	    creeping about the screen following the cursor.
	o - Took colons off of device buttons on browse menu and file
		selector.
	o - #25797 - Path/clocked speed is back to normal.  The rest of
	    this one is NAB.  We feel it's easier to see the path as a
		polygon in view mode.
	o - #30415 - Titling edit screen background color is painted
	    in menu dark color rather than color 0.  This makes
		'undrawing' of text not leave trails.  Also will be
		more visible if color 0 is not black.
	o - #30422 - Type on titling works again.

9/22/90 jk (pj36)
	o - #????? Got rid of all check_dos_dfree() calls and eliminated this
	    function (which would bring up the "only xxxx bytes free on
		scratch drive" alert followed by way to pick a new scratch
		drive, but rest of program ignores scratch drive in favor
		of the new "temp path" stuff.
	o - Integrated Ian's latest poco updates.  Mostly stuff to make
	    Poco closer to ANSI C.
	o - #30423 Optics/View after creating a path crash fixed.
		(Same fix made filled splines not crash.)

9/19/90 jk (pj35)
	o - Archived source 7:00 am 9/19
FEATURES CHANGES:
	o - #25758 - There is no longer a tween button in the tools panel
		for Poly or Spline.   Basically this was leading to a lot of
		problems with 'circular' paths through the menus and other
		ambiguities, and seems not so necessary with Tween a
		home pull-down item.
	o - Cel paste advances to next frame of cel if Advance Cel is on.
	o - Moved Advance Cel to AnimCel/options from AnimCel/Paste and
		AnimCel/Sprite.
	o - Renamed AnimCel/Options/Auto fit colors to simply Fit colors.
	o - Cel/Clip works over time.  (Actually Peter put this in a
		few versions ago but I forgot to mention it here.)
BUG FIXES:
	o - #30416 - subdirectories in resource don't make wierd error
	    message come up in set-screen-size.
		(Changed TRUE to FALSE in last parameter to build_wild_list()
		in screenmu.c).
	o - #25798 - rendering optics with flic/cel brings up "unsaved changes"
		prompt when loading new flic.
		Fix was to put:
			dirty_file = TRUE;
		after the dirty_stroke incrementing in dall() and dseg().
		This bug was actually more pervasive than just in optics,
		but normally hidden because LOTS of things set dirty_file to TRUE.
	o - #????? - Undo and redo buttons on menus called from time
		selector are disabled (greyed).  Using them from time selector
		would cause erratic and generally buggy results.
	o - #25795 - crash on optics preview with l-grad ink fixed
		#25794 - crash on optics preview with glaze ink.
		In render.c/is_transp_ink() changed lsp_INKID to tlc_INKID.
		(These are the internal representations of lgrad and glaze
		in respectively.  In this routine lgrad was substituted for
		glaze.  Oops.)
	o - #30419 - crash when using font or displaying font sample
	    in tools panel after reset.
		(in font/cfont.c got rid of 'stacking' of grab/release font
		calls and got rid of bogus calls to grab/release font
		in title.c and redo.c)
	o - #????? - tween temp file is deleted when you quit/abandon.
	o - #30601 - slice ink with no ink strength slider
		#30602 - crash on merge ink
		Fixed a bunch of stuff that broke when Peter unified all the
		loadable driver handling.  Loadable inks have an initialization
		routine that gets called on startup that let them set up
		the sliders and cashes they need again.  New field - init_inks - in
		RootInk data structure and a call to it in inkopts/load_ink_driver().
	o - #30605 - L Grad ink funky in draw with big brush
		(Internally force L Grad to be H Grad in this case.)

9/17/90 jk (pj34 - released to Ian Lepore & uploaded to Autodesk)
FEATURES CHANGES:
	o - Added 'close box' to files menu and all numbered choice menus.
	o - In optics right click or space no longer takes you out of
	    optics.  <Escape> key,  close box, or the new "Quit" selection
		does.
	o - Renamed _getclock to _rawclock and put in a filtering routine
	    (called _getclock) that corrects for when _rawclock goes
		backwards due to asynchronicities between hardware clock and
		DOS interrupt processing.   Uncommented the low byte
		(hardware part) of _rawclock and _goclock.  The result is
		a clock granularity of 4659Hz instead of 18.2Hz, and smoother
		playback of animations.
BUG FIXES:
	o - Removed S single key equiv from Cel/Stretch.  (#25757)
	o - Capitalized "Join" in message "Abort Join on frame xxx of yyy".
		(#30404)
	o - Added missing string parameter to yes_no_box in really_delete()
	    with the effect of fixing bug #25790.
	o - Open/closed paths are displayed correctly when using Optics/Path/Edit.
		(#25774)
	o - Open/closed paths displayed correctly when in Optics/Path
		and creating a path. (#25775)
	o - Optics path isn't cleared each time you enter optics.
		(Fixes a bug introduced in PJ33.)
	o - Abusively large shape (2048 points or more) brings up error
	    message instead of crashing when used as an optics path.
		This fixes #25759, and a similar bug that would occur
		if you drew huge shape and then 'reused' it as a filled spline.
		(Added check in spline.c/make_sp_poly.) 
	o - Changed:
			while(count > 1)
		to:
			while(count > 0)
		in sep.c/in_cnums() with the effect of fixing Sep. near bug
		#30600.  This might fix a bug or ten in the color palette too,
		which used this routine heavily.
	o - Changed a "Pixel" to an "int" in parameter list to brighten_ccomp
		in inkdot2.c.  This fixes some problems with bright ink. (#30603)
	o - Changed 2 "SHORT"s to "long" in inkdot2.c/emb1c().  This is
	    to fix a _possible_ problem with emboss ink.
	o - Changed "SHORT"s to "long"s in parameter list to 
		inkdot.c/dfrom_range() to fix bug in gradient inks with
		more than 100 colors in bundle.
	o - Changed some SHORT's to long's in inkdot/vsp_hline().
			long p,q;
			long fac1, fac2, fac3;
		This carries above fix to horizontal lines as well as dots.
	o - Similar change to inkdot/hsp_hline().
	o - '=' key brings up a directory of the 'trd' ram device rather
	    than crashing.  (This is just a feature for testing.)
	o - Made line gradient rendering of polys same as horizontal
	    gradient as in Animator 1.0 and 1.01.  

9/10/90 jk	(uploaded as PJ33)
	(Note there's no point to reading pj.doc on this one as it
	just repeats this.)
	o - Archived source.
FEATURES CHANGES:
	o - Adding 'close boxes' to most menus that don't have them.  
	    (Based on positive feedback from alpha sites.)  So far have
		done:  tools, inks, optics, palette, titling, time select.
		(This may have side effect of home panel not tracking
		movements of these menus.)
	o - Removed 'undo' from optics panel as per Jack's suggestion.
	o - Removed 'T' Time-select button from optics panel.  From PJ's
	    point of view Time-select is always on inside optics.  This
		addresses bug #25768, though it's not really a fix.
	o - Installed a method so that 'numbered choice' menus can have
		disabled items.  Used this on the record macro to among other
		things fix bug #25781.
	o - More work has been done on Poco.  The preprocessor has been
		upgraded to be about 95% ANSI compatible.  Recursive
		preprocessor definitions are trapped rather than hanging
		the machine.   New preprocessor commands:
			#if
			#elif
			#error
			defined(symbol)
	o - ADI code no longer linked in.
BUG FIXES:
	o - Fixed bogus setting of render under when doing anim cel/set key
	    (#25752)
	o - After loading a file from files menu,  save button will be
	    ungreyed if necessary.  (#25760)
	o - In files macro save is greyed out if no macro.
		(note on bottom of #25760)
	o - In files menus load/save text does text instead of path.
	    (#25783)
	o - All save operations in files menu bring up 'overwrite old'
	    dialog when appropriate.  (#25766)
	o - Corrected 'abort join' alert box.  (#30404)
	o - Save mask now has 'save' on button rather than 'load'. (#25784)
	o - Mask button on time select panel greyed out when appropriate.
		(#25776)
	o - Selecting Optics/Element/Set Cel doesn't select Outline as
	    well.  (#25762)
	o - Can now do Optics with a poly element and tile ink. (#25765)
	o - Made directory handling for various file types more consistent.
	    Used to be poly, path, settings, optics, and record shared
		a directory while all others had their own directory.  Now
		everything has it's own directory.  In addition some places
		where the directory was there but only partially implemented
		are fixed.
		(As part of the process I _may_ have fixed #25790, but
		was never properly able to reproduce that one.  The
		delete code did change though.)
	o - Optics/clear move  clears the path as well.  (John mentioned
		this as a possible bug, and indeed it was.)
	o - Changed some MB_GHILITE's to MB_B_GHILITES in the data 
		declarations of the optics panel with the effect of fixing
		bugs #25771, #25773, #25779, and #25780.  (Please test
		these though.  Basically when I saw #25771 I knew this
		was the problem and saw it in a few places, fixed all the
		ones I saw, and since have not been able to reproduce
		the other bugs.)
	o - In optics with flic element, make background come in as
	    key color rather than color 0.  (This was a bug that was
		fixed in the transition between 1.0 and 1.01 of lo-res
		animator.  If you have records it'd be good to check all
		those bugs because most of them will be in PJ.  (Then again
		you may be ahead of me on this.))
	o - Added following line of code to start of do_move_along()
		to get rid of "1/4 turn in y no wire-frame continue-move"
		bug:
				make_rot_op();
		(fixes bug #25572)
	o - Clear move updates sliders.  (#30411)
	o - Modified tween1() to bypass tweening calculations on first
	    and last frames.  This fixes most  of bug #25770
	o - Brought in calc_ease_in() from aa 1.01.  Makes ease in/ease out
		more accurate on the first and last frames.  This is needed to 
		make the fix to #25770 apply when in-slow/out-slow is involved.
	(Note, fixing #25770 when tween is an optics element will 
	take a bit more work yet.)

9/4/90 pk (& jk integrating Released as PJ32)
	o - hopefully final cleanup of image file module interface can now
		select modules to read and write flics as well as pics
	o - added clip cel over time to serch all frames for max non tcolor
		boundary and clip frames.
	o - fixed cel marqui an cancel bug.
	o - do not free cel now until actual clip so if time menu is aborted
		old cel remains intact. If abort takes place after thr "render" of 
		clipping is initiated old cel is trashed.
	o - created write only module for saving of animator 1.0 flis.
	o - changed anim file selector protocall to allow selection of read only
		modules and attempt to read from it first then search the rest.
9/04/90 jk
	o - Made palette use swap_undo rather than pal_undo.  Pal_undo
		was quicker, but wouldn't work in cases where pixels changed
		by color fitting.
8/28/90 pk (& jk integrating.  Released as PJ31)
	o - finished interface for loadable animation file read and
	    write modules.
	o - Installed all host side interface and handling for animation
	    file io modules.
	o - Put in selector menu for current flic save type.
	o - added flisave_pdr to Vconfig do a delsymo for vconfg.
8/26/90 jk
	o - Integrated new poco.c and poco.h from Ian.  This does
	    expression frame caching.  Compiler now over 2x as fast as
		pre-ian version.  Yay!
	o - More futzing with ADI mouse driver.  Still crasho, but at
	    least we actually are executing some code in the driver for sure.
8/25/90 jk
	o - Integrated Ian's version of Poco.  Compiler sped up nearly 2x.
	o - Fixed mask-free/mask create crash.
8/24/90 jk
	o - Got rid of old .POC files from poco directory.
	o - Ian's rev of poco is in ianpoco directory.


8/23/90 jk (uploaded as pj29)
	o - Banged head against ADI drivers.  Decided to cut feature.
	o - Keep info from critical error handler in global crit_errval.

8/20/90 pk	(&jk integrated)
	o - found bug where scale_xys() was overwriting 4 bytes of data segement
		and was causing a string overwrite.
	o - Fixed save default settings bug in fii_first_black() compression
	    buffer too small and on stack.
	o - Fixed driver bug where raster type numbers were not being set to
		mode + first_rtype and causing crash on any mode 2 from driver
	o - Installed id_string comparison in rexlib loader to handle 
	    non-documented user types separately from adi type rex drivers
		to avoid collision. Rex library format is frozen as far as I'm 
		concerned.
	o - Built 3 librarys for passing to rex librarys, and librarys of
	    calls to be linked in by rex driver library developers.
		for aasyslib.lib, gfxlib.lib, and stdiolib.lib and the corresponding
		host provided vector librarys aa_syslib, aa_gfxlib, and aa_stdiolib.
	o - Finished up rex library interface including a standard host provided
		library rondesvous system.
	o - Video driver failure to open screen recovers and restores previous
		mode correctly.

8/20/90 jk (archived)
	o - Error message text from errtext.c is now in aa.mu.
	o - Fixed bug in lfseek()
	o - Got rid of a bit of unused code here and there.

8/18/90 jk (peeled off an archive)
	o - Pull downs are now read from resource/aa.mu.

8/16/90 jk (pj28)
	o - Insert and delete key equiv's
	o - More work on pull-downs loadable from a text file in resource.
	o - Pull downs have horizontal line in place of "--------", which
	    looks better, especially in hi res prop. space fonts.
	o - Pull downs don't box hilite disabled items.
	o - Warnings on release Cel,Mask, & Swap.
	o - <Esc> key doesn't bring up quit dialog.
	o - Right click over ink/tool buttons takes you to ink/tool panel
		from Tween and Cel panels.
	o - Some renaming - SEG to join.  Cel Sprite/Scale to Stretch.

8/12/90 jk
	o - Right click over menu title button moves menu to lower left corner.
	o - Color group of 8 has rounded buttons.

	o - Redid the menu-colors sets in the palette pull-down.

8/09/90 jk (uploaded as pj26)
	o - Re-arranged parameters to poco functions 'IconBlit', 'Blit', and
		'KeyBlit'.  Width,height is now after sx,sy in all cases.
	o - Got rid of 'pick' cursor in mini color palette.
	o - Made more of the radio buttons have beveled corners and more
		of the toggle buttons have square corners.
	o - Made more menus come up where home panel is rather than
	    by default 3/4 of the way down the screen in hi res.
	o - if screen res is 800 or wider I scale the menus up more and use
	    "aahrmenu.fnt".
	o - put 'count' under flic pulldown.  It takes you to the 'set total
		frames' dialog.
	o - Went through most menus and made all buttons' text start with a capital
	    but the rest in lower case.
	o - New color menu layout.
	o - Buttons with beveled corners now look more distinct
	    from square corner buttons in the higher resolutions.
	o - Separate confirmation dialog when loading a new flic over changes.



8/06/90 pk (&jk integrating)
	o - Mostly work on making all loadable rex drivers follow the same
	    protocal.  Refinement of video driver spec.  Not frozen, but
		very slushy.

8/06/90 jk
	o - Fixed 8514 driver.
	o - Code changes to gfx and rlib to make 'mode' get passed down to
	    vd_open_cel (or some such routine) instead of passing 0 for mode
		always.  (Fixed bug where PJ ended up using lower half of super
		hi-res 8514 for undo screen.)
	o - Put extra button in zoom menu, but not implemented yet.
	o - Changed seeme for see_frame_ix button on home panel and elsewhere.
	o - Put RubLine() function into poco.
	o - Panning zoom-window follows click-click instead of mouse-drag.
	o - Redid optics panel a bit.  Got rid of 'M' mask button and
	    'MultiCel' button.  Have 'view' and 'loop' (a once through and
		looping wireframe) and 'clear move' to go with 'clear track'.
		Clear move sets all sliders to default positions, but doesn't
		clear previous 'continu move's.  (Also renamed continue move
		to simple continue.)

7/26/90 jk (&pk integrating)
	o - Fixed a few poco bugs.  Functions that are used & prototyped
	    but never defined generate an error message instead of bad code.

7/26/90 pk
	o - global changes:
#define gentle_close(f) jclose(f)
	o - lots of breaking things up into little dinky modules and putting
	    them into libraries.


7/20/90 jk (&pk integrating)
	o - More work putting optics into poco.
	o - In previews color map isn't updated if it hasn't changed.
	o - Made string button clear if first  character pressed isn't
	     an editing char as seems standard these days on the PC.
	o - changed printf's in wndo/textbox.c to fprintf(stderr, ...)
	    and include lstdio.h in that file so it's redirected to
		the lfile version.  (I wonder what other printf's are left.)
	o - Palette|Menu Colors is changed.  Got a choice of 4 canned color
		sets or 5 from end of palette.

7/20/90 pk
	o - Separating out fli-related modules into \paa\fli for
	    librarification.   Lots of global name changes in the process.
	o - Fixed some clock related & macro timing bugs.  (low 8 bits of
	    clock commented out.)
	o - Macro records pressure.
	o - More polishing of input.

7/14/90 pk
	o - More work on macros.  Can abort them on right click.  General
	    cleanup of input.  Hot key handling.

7/14/90 jk
	o - Finished eliminating bfile.  Got rid of bfile.h and bfile.c.
	o - Text editor saves files with <cr><lf> instead of just <lf>
	    at end of line (like most MSDOS programs...)
	o - Fixed bugs in lungetc and lstdout and lstderr.
	o - Started working on putting optics support into poco.  (Not very
	    far yet.)

7/09/90 pk (&jk integrating)
	o - More macro work.  You can abort macros now.  They sync up
	    during poll_abort operations such as occur when drawing
		filled shapes or render_blits.
7/09/90 jk
	o - Put in quick color grid menu on left click over ccolor sel.
	o - LFILE system (compatible with FILE and defined as such in
		lstdio.h) is in poco\lfile.c.  So far only Poco and gif saves
		go through this.

7/06/90 pk (&jk integrating)
	o - Mostly work re-implementing macros.
	o - Less bugs in SEG.

7/06/90 jk
	o - Changes to input.c and vpaint.c to re-implement the low level
	    'hot key' functions to save current screen as snapshot.gif,
		remember current cursor position etc.
	o - Made font requestor work again.
	o - Cut speedo fonts.  (Doesn't seem to compile correctly with new
	    Watcom,  sigh.)
	o - Working on making set temp path handling more robust.
	o - Removed last bits of file handling (in poco) that depend on
		temp device (as opposed to using temp path.)
	o - Added stroke count to unsaved changes message.
	o - Unsaved changes message is included in new & reset requestor.
	o - Unsaved changes message is included in 'load flic' file
	     requestor header.
	o - Unsaved changes message comes up in yes/no box after browse/load
	    if there are unsaved changes.
	o - Auto operations don't clear 'dirty_file' flag when they shouldn't.

7/02/90 jk (&pk integrating)
	o - Added grclib to entry parameters for display drivers.
	o - Made 'display.h',  in drivekit.  It's a synthesis of parts of
	    about 6 PJ .h files.  It and 'errcodes.h' are all the
		display drivers need to include.
	o - Modified source so it will compile with High C.  (You still
	    get warning messages from unused function parameters, which
		seems unavoidable, damn.)   High C is strict on the type-checking
		of function pointers.  It's sort of nice, but as a consequence
		had to redo drivers to reference hardware specific parts through
		the union part of your generic raster.
	o - Made a 'testdev' program that just prints the information about
	    a driver.
7/02/90 pk 
	o - continuing work on SEG.
6/24/90 jk (&pk integrating)
	o - deleted unused pocoedit.c file from root.
	o - added font\sail.c and use this font in lo res poco.
	o - renamed vdlocal.h to vdevice.h and vdriver.h to modeinfo.h
	o - moved all driver source to drivekit directory.
6/24/90 PK
	o - empty_tempflx(num_frames) now takes number of frames as input
	o - cel now increments frame on apply ink in tile ink
6/18/90 jk (&pk integrated)
	o - changed RGB_MAX from 64 to 256, and generally made
	    internal representation of rgb values 4* what they used to be.
	o - worked on drivekit  some more.  Main thing was making a
	    new jfile.c stub for torturer so that could use syslib in
		torturer.
	o - redoing mcga driver to follow pattern of null.drv
	o - some changes in rlib directory to allow NULL functions in
	    display driver device library.
	o - changes in rlib\vdriver.c to make driver opening more
	    closely follow protocol of driver torture program.
6/15/90 jk (&pk integrated)
	o - Split off textfile.c from textedit.c (which was running out of
	    memory compiling.)
	o - proformed global substitutions to make lo-level ms-dos file
	    routine use fli.lib style names.

	o - Implemented poco screen&blit libraries.
	o - Got poco to free up all the memory it uses in more cases.
	o - Took out poco effect item (since can do it with OverTime()).

5/27/90 JK (&pk integrating)
	o - Lots of poco related work.  New format for libraries.
5/24/90 JK

	o - Fixed bug where fopen/fclose in poco crashed.
	o - Fixed 60 byte frags in pstamp.c.
	o - view works in browse again.

5/23/90 JK
	o - Put in a poco drop-down menu, the last part of which is a selection
	    for the 1st 10 .poc files in the resource directory.
	o - Fixed bug where poco would crash if the file it was trying to run
	    didn't exist.
	o - Put in poco effect selection on drop-down.  It
 		looks for *.POE, and will call the function:
			entry(double tscale)
		inside of do-auto.
	o - Backed up to pj18 and uploaded.

5/22/90 PK (&jk integrating)
	o - added build_bytemap() call to ramrast.c
	o - changed (added new call) text formatted qchoicef() to eventually
	    supercede others.
	o - activated title bar on qchoice menus.
	o - removed code to build and maintain "empty frame" records in time.c

	o - Starting to work on Poco  some more.  Implemented switch statement
		and initialization of structs and multidimensional arrays.
		Some poco debugging.

5/18/90 JK (&pk integrating)
	o - Put in panel part of tween system.
	o - Added pull_toptext() to adjust y position of top line of
	    pull-down text (which was too low, especially in low res.)
5/17/90 JK
	o - More tweening.  'link points' is starting to work pretty well.
	o - Backed up 5-17-90 7:10
5/18/90 PK
	o - moved parse_to_semi() to filepath.c and added maxlen arg.
	o - took excessive unzoom() rezoom()'s out of file operations.
	o - added multiple paths in config
	o - modified get_filename to handle input path, and multiple suffi
	o - cleaned up filemenu.c added wild card buttons and 4 more optional
		devices made device buttons dynamic.
5/13/90 PK (&jk integrating)

		move/clear-links.
	o - Made tweening between open shapes more accurate.
	o - Backed up 5-13-90 23:40:00
5/12/90 JK -  
	o - Added following snippet to memory.h:
		#define news(t)  ((((t) = askcmem(sizeof(*(t)))) != NULL) \
			? Success : Err_no_memory)
	o - More features in tweening menu.  "Blow" and "Link Points"
	    are new.   Blow's like magnet but a bit  more diffuse.
		Link Points is still in progress.  It lets you set up the
		links, but during the actual tweening only the first link
		matters.  Think there are still a few ways to crash this one.
	o - Split tween.c into 3 files cause compiler ran out of memory.
	    polytwee.c which may have some reusable code in it,
		tweenpul.c, and tween.c.

		this in the temp filing system.  Using this in tween system
		and in place of slower 'push_pic' in do_preview() in auto.c,
		in a3d.c, browse.c, flicel.c, and blue.c

	o - Tween stuff is at a good stopping place.  You can set either
	    end of the tween to a poly,shape,star,oval,petal,rpoly, or loaded
		shape.  You can't adjust the ends though.  About 3/4 of the
		first pass at the tween pulldown is in place.  Haven't started
		on the tween panel yet.  Think it may be just the 1st two lines
		of the cel-tools panel.

		unessesary calculations for getting the width in many functions
		and to prepare the Rectangle structure to be part of the new
		screen and graphics calls.

	o - replaced function draw_frame with draw_rect using width and height
