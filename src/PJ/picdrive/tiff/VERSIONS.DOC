TIFF picture driver version notes...

	12-08-90  1-3	Preliminary versions.

	12-08-90  004	First really functional version, released to Jim.

	12-20-90  005	Added code to TIFWRITE.C to ensure IFD always get written
					on an even word boundry in the file (per TIFF 5.0 specs).

	01-18-91  006	Added support for TIFF color-mapped format.  Also, some
					tweaks to pave the way for RGB support and LZW support.

	01-19-91  007	Added support for LZW decompression.

	01-21-91  008	Created two versions of the TIFF driver.  TIFF.PDR will
					read all non-RGB tiff files, and will write color palette
					format tiff files.	TIFFGREY.PDR doesn't read at all, but
					it will write greyscale tiff format files.	At this point,
					all the functionality needed for the PJ tiff PDRs is
					implemenented; further changes will be for the portions of
					the code shared by the PJ and CONVERT versions of the TIFF
					driver.  (Also, there is some question about the way
					palette colors from the tiff file are scaled to SVGA
					levels.  Need to check this.)  Fixed a bug in write_dirent
					(TIFWRITE.C) that was affecting the output of the color
					map (it was writing a bogus file offset into the IFD.)
					Also, added interface to CONVERT's new ability to conduct
					Qchoice() dialogs to obtain output format and compression
					options from the user.	And, added more tweaks to assist
					in handling RGB.

	01-23-91  009	Added RGB output.

	01-31-91  010	Full support for RGB input via the new PDR interface
					routines rgb_seekstart() and rgb_readline(). Tested and
					debugged at this point.

	02-02-91  011	Made default (PJ) output type 256-level greyscale; there
					is no longer a separate greyscale driver, and color output
					is available through CONVERT's Pdroptions dialog interface.

	03-14-91  012	Added support for LZW output compression.  I think at this
					point we support just about every TIFF option in existance.

	06-08-91  013	Fixed a bug in MTOSCRN.C: the logic to call decompressors
					now passes 'bpr' instead of 'width' to the unpackbits()
					routine.  (Using width is wrong when bits_per_sample != 8).

	06-11-91  014	Fixed a bug in LZWCMPRS.C: some special endcase handling
					was added to bump up the output codesize before writing
					the EOFCODE, if the last output code was max_code.	This
					version is all full of debugging output calls.

	06-11-91  015	This is version 14 without the debugging output.  Also,
					the output stripsize was dropped from 16k to 8k.  8k is
					the TIFF-standard recommended stripsize, and it seems to
					give better (!) LZW compression, equal performance, and on
					a load it looks smoother (and it looks faster, although
					it's a teeny tiny bit slower).
