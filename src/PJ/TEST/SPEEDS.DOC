My thoughts on this is we should go with the stack protocall which is more
likely stably supportable than watcoms register protocall.  If someone really
needs super speed they should write their code in assembler and call the 80387
directly.  Jim: do you know how I can see if I have a 80387 on my 
machine? Run386 is supposed to have a flag that will enable/disable use of it
on the command line.  You have the manual.  It seems by the percentage of time 
occupied by arg passing and jumping I do have a 80387.
