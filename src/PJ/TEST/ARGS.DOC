
The argument parser format is:


In a string the sequence !addd is a replacable argument ddd is any number
of digits that represent the argument number.

ie:	!a01 is argument #1 so is !a1 and !a0001

!a1 is the first argument !a0 is invalid !a32 is the largest number accepted.

the char '\' must be a double back slash '\\' in the string. '\n' is '\n'.
the char '%' is a single character and is printed as is.

On the host side formats are strings of ansi style "printf" formats delimited
by their '%' characters.  the string "%.*s%d%2.4f%c" is four formats,

"%.*s", "%d", "%2.4f", and "%c",  

The first one "%.*s" is considered one argument even though it requires
the caller to supply both an int and a char *.

These formats must match what is on the stack or in the va_list or else!
