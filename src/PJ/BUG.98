Number    Problem Description
======    =================================================================


 34932  2 9/3/92, PJ94:  According to Jim Kent, the Wacom tablet problem 
 offsite
          appears to be a hardware one.  He's checking for pointing device 
          off tablet, but apparently the signal isn't being generated 
          correctly.
          
          -----------------------------------------------------------------
          
          When using the Wacom tablet, the cursor appears in unwanted 
          locations with no command from the input device.
          
          1.  Set the stylus or puck off of the tablet, with the cursor in 
          the center of the Tween screen (with Shape/Poly selected).
          2.  After several minutes a line will appear from the cursor to 
          another unselected point.
          
          This occurs with both the Compaq and PS2/70.
          
 55825  3 [Sample text doesn`t accurately display when spacing value is 
 low
          changed.
          
          1.  Open the Fonts panel
          2.  Select the ARCHITXT.PFB font
          3.  Set Height to 40
          4.  Open the Spacing dlog and gradually increase the spacing 
          
          Bug:  As spacing increases, the top sample line moves up.  When 
          spacing reaches 35 or so, the top line jumps down and then moves 
          up again until spacing reaches 109 or so when the top line jumps 
          to the middle of the box.  
 55826  2 Maximum leading value gets confused when Height is changed.
 low
          
          1.  Load ARCHITXT.PFB and set height to 20
          2.  CHange Spacing to maximum value (should be 100)
          3.  Change Height to 100
          4.  Change Spacing to maximum (495)
          5.  Change Height back to 20
          
          Bug:  Leading is still set to 495. If I open the Leading field, 
          don't change anything, then click OK, I get an error message.

          2.  Select Set SLide Style
          3.  Select Title
          4.  Select Justify Title
          5.  Select Right
          
          Bug:  Title isn't placed flush to right margin - it's indented a 
          few spaces.  

 55833  2 In low memory, changing screen size puts user into loop 
 ~~~
          between Out of Memory dlog and screen size dlog.
          
          1.  Type "`" and eat up as much memory as possible
          2.  Select Screen Size from the Extra menu
          3.  Set to 800x600
          4.  Click Yes
          5.  Out of Memory Alert
          6.  Click Continue
          
          Bug:  Returned to Screen Format Menu. Clicking cancel just brings 
          up the low memory alert.  Shouldn't cancel put the user back 
          where he started?

 55839  2 To escape from POCO help, user has to enter ESC twice.
 NAB
          
          1.  Select Programming from the POCO menu
          2.  Select Edit
          3.  Type F1

          Bug:  Help should have closed.  User has to hit ESC a second time 
          to close.

 55841  2 The Copy button in the Copy and Move tools doesn't seem to have 
 NAB
          much purpose.
          
          1.  Select the Copy tool
          2.  Click on the Copy button under the One Color button

          Copy and Move.
          
          Same result with Move.  It seems more confusing to have the 
          button than to not have it.

          Bug:  Notice the bottom of rounded letters - b, c, d, o, p, etc. 
          - which are flattened on the baseline, rather than displaying 
          round as they should.  This happens with a number of other .pfb 
          fonts.

          1.  Load Vector Arts ACE.pfb

          1. In Ani Pro load the Vector Arts font Arctic.pfb
          2. Type ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) _ + } { ~ > <
          
          Bug:  Nothing happens, are these characters simply not in the

 55863  2 When running under Windows, switching out of ANIPRO, then back in 
 NFL

          5.  Type Esc
          6.  Alert Skip to next slide - Click Yes
          7.  Type Esc
          8.  Alert Abort Preview
          
          Bug:  Esc should always abort the preview.

 55867  2 In Show'em, loading a style file which uses a background that is

          color is selected.

 55869  2 Postscript fonts have to have the .pfb file extension to be

          1.  Rename a .pfb font to use the file extension .tst
          2.  Load the .tst font
          
          Bug:  Get alert:  Unknown font type.  Bitmap fonts don't require

          same way.

          2.  Select Set Slide Style
          3.  Select 7 Output

          -----------------------------------------------------------
          
          Then selecting New from the Poco Programming menu, the user is 
          not prompted to save changes to current program before removing 
          it from memory.

          2.  Select Edit and type in some text.
          3.  Select New.
          4.  Notice the text is now deleted when you select Edit.

 57001  1 Random crashes occur when using Anim Cel for long periods of 
          time.  This has happened in product support and when previously 
          testing Animator Pro 1.0.

 57005  3 When previewing, top of screen should say "Press any key..."
 NAB
          
          1.  Load Show'em.
          2.  Select Create Slide Show.
          3.  Select Edit text and type in a few characters.
          4.  Select Preview.
          5.  Top of screen should say "Press any key....".

 57006  3 Need to change "it's" to "its" on last screen of Create Slide 
 fixed
          Show help.
          
          1.  Load Show'em.
          2.  Select Create Slide Show/Help.
          3.  Go to the 3rd help screen.  On the bottom line "it's" should 
          be changed to "its".

 57007  2 Naming convention for saving rendered files to disk should be 
 fixed/NAB
          changed.
          
          1.  Load Show'em.
          2.  Select Create Slide Show/Edit Text.
          3.  Type in some text to create 3 slides.
          4.  Select Render Slides.
          5.  Notice the filenames generated are:   Show000a.flc

                                                    Show020a.flc
          
          It would make more sense to use a numeric numbering system, ie:  
                                                    Show0001.flc

          A crash occurs when booting up Ani Pro and not all devices are 
          turned on.  
          
          When booting up, the software looks for all devices--if those 
          devices are NOT TURNED ON, it crashes.  For example, if the 
          bernoulli drives are off, the program will crash.

 92655  2 DIGITIZER: Aspect ratio of driver is incorrect for Wacom 420E and
 offsite
          510.
          
          PROCEDURE:
          Connect and configure for a Wacom tablet using AApro's supplied 
          Wacom driver, WACOM.IDR.  Next, enter AAPro and, using a draw tool 
          and the digitizer's stylus, trace around a round object.  The 
          resulting image in AAPro is an ellipsoid instead of a circle.
