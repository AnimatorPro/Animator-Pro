INTRODUCTION & INSTALLATION 

    BULLET.POC is an Animator Professional POCO program that is designed to 
place shadowed 'bullets', either single or double, on presentation charts. 
The ZIP file contains a total of 6 files. These files should be 
copied/moved to the indicated directories, and are: 

    BULLET.DOC   - This file, containing the documentation. This file is 
                   not needed for program operation. 
    BULLET.POC   - The ASCII text file containing the program. This file 
                   should be placed in the Animator Pro resource directory 
                   (typically this would be \ANI\RESOURCE) if you want the 
                   program to be instantly available from the Animator Poco 
                   menu. If you just want to access the program by using 
                   the "Use" item from the Poco menu, it can be placed in 
                   any directory. 
    L-BULLET.CEL - The CEL file for the 'bullet' used with a screen size of 
                   800x600. This file and the following .CEL files should 
                   be placed in the Animator Pro home directory, typically 
                   \ANI. If this is not satisfactory, you will have to 
                   modify the code in BULLET.POC to specify the complete 
                   path and directory where the files are located. 
    M_BULLET.CEL - The CEL file for the 'bullet' used for a screen size of 
                   640x480. 
    S-BULLET.CEL - The CEL file for the 'bullet' used for a screen size of 
                   320x200. 
    V-BULLET.CEL - The CEL file for the 'bullet' used for a screen size of 
                   1024x768. 
 
OPERATION

    The program is designed to operate with the Animator Time Select turned 
off, i.e. you are working on a single frame. I have not found this to be 
any disadvantage since I generally do a chart as a single frame to 
completion, and then apply any animation such as fades or dissolves after 
the basic chart is finished. The program also works ONLY with standard 
screen sizes of 320x200, 640x480, 800x600, and 1024x768 pixels. If selected 
with some other screen size active, the program automatically terminates 
without any user prompts. This is intentional within the program and can be 
disabled by modification. 

    When selected from the Poco menu, the program reminds you that your 
current active CEL will be over-written and gives you the option of 
terminating the program. (Note: I tried to save and automatically restore 
any active CEL, but due to either Animator bugs and/or inadequate 
documentation, was unable to use the Poco SaveCel() function reliably. It 
would work the first time the program was invoked, but not thereafter.) 

    The program then asks whether you want a single or double bullet (plus 
another opportunity to Cancel everything). Once single or double is 
selected, move the cursor to the desired location and left click the mouse 
to apply the 'bullet' to the chart. At this point, you can continue to 
apply bullets by left clicking the mouse or terminate by a right click of 
the mouse.

    The 'bullet' shadow is applied using Animator's DARK ink at whatever 
strength is current. If you want the shadow darker or lighter, you need to 
adjust the DARK ink strength before Bullet is used. Note that you do not 
have to select any ink prior to use, since Bullet automatically uses the 
proper ink and restores the original ink upon exiting.

PROGRAM MODIFICATION

    Several modifications to the code are possible if you wish to modify 
the built-in conditions and defaults. Unlike many other Poco programs I've 
looked at, this should be easily modified by a non-C programmer, since the 
program was formatted to be readable and contains extensive comments. Also, 
it is obviously possible to substitute your own CEL files for those 
contained with the package. 

WHY FREEware?

    I'm placing this program into the public domain since I don't believe 
that it is ethical to request money for work that someone else has already 
paid for, in this case my employer, the Naval Research Laboratory. I've 
wondered just how much of the Shareware that is available represents 
original effort directed towards the market at large? 

    I also think that every now and then, its nice for someone using this 
forum be able to get something for nothing that's useful as opposed to the 
somewhat backward idea of paying for the privilege (by the Compuserve 
charges) of reading advertisements from others.

I neither read, nor answer any mail directed to my Compuserve account since 
this must come out of my own pocket as my employer is to cheap to subsidize 
it. My mailing address is:
