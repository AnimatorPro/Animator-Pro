1.0 Introduction

TileWorks is a shareware utility for use with Autodesk Animator Pro software. 
It is written in Animator Pro's Poco programming language.  TileWorks is
capable of generating facinating and unique repeatable patterns which can 
then be tiled and saved to both cel and gif file formats.  A variety of 
controls exist in TileWorks that when combined with Animator Pro give 
capablities limited only by your imagination.  TileWorks is based on a
MicroSoft Windows screensaver "Screenplay" which is also available from 
Kamyan Software.

TileWorks has been designed in a way to allow you to make use of the
power of Animator Pro.  Your current settings within TileWorks are saved
each time you exit TileWorks and then automatically restored when you
restart TileWorks.  This allows you to setup a tile pattern, exit back to
Animator Pro change inks, process the tile area etc. then return to 
TileWorks to continue or save the tile area as a cel or gif file.  The 
file tilewk.set will be created the first time you run Tileworks. It
will be created in the Animator Pro directory.

for convenience.  The following items will take place when using this
