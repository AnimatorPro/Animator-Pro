Outstanding bugs...


 ------> Nested block scoping doesn't work at all.  See SCOPE.POC.

Recently-fixed bugs...


 182 --> Can't define array of aggregate types with dimension
         of array inferred from init expressions.

 184 --> Can't dereference the return value of a function
         that returns a pointer. (IE, x = *intptrfunc() fails.)

 184 --> GetProgramDir() crashes.

 185 --> An unexpected '}' doesn't cause an error.

 185 --> Error in preprocessor directives within a poco program
 [41900] that occurs before the first non-pp token of the
         program is seen reports the line number of the last
         builtin lib proto that was processed.  Also, preprocessor
         errors following conditional compilation sections are wrong.

 185 --> FLISUMRY.POC: an off-by-one bug involving the number of
 [35610] output frames causes the first frame to have just 1 pstamp.

 185 --> An auto var larger than the runtime stacksize crashes.

 185 --> Line number reporting on an error/stack-trace is wrong when
         the error line is the first line in the function.  (More
         specifically, when it's the first item in the linedata associated
         with the function.)

 185 --> Name of an array is not properly recognized as a
         constant expression for its address in init expressions.
         (But &arrayname[0] works fine (due to bug listed below)).

 185 --> Address-of operator makes any following expression look to be
         a pure constant, even if it's not (ie, &(*ptr);).
