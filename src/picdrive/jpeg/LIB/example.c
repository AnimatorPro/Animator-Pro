 * This file illustrates how to use the JPEG code as a subroutine library
 * to read or write JPEG image files.  We assume here that you are not
 * merely interested in converting the image to yet another image file format
 * (if you are, you should be adding another I/O module to cjpeg/djpeg, not
 * constructing a new application).  Instead, we show how to pass the
 * decompressed image data into or out of routines that you provide.  For
 * example, a viewer program might use the JPEG decompressor together with
 * routines that write the decompressed image directly to a display.
 *
 * We present these routines in the same coding style used in the JPEG code
 * (ANSI function definitions, etc); but you are of course free to code your
 * routines in a different style if you prefer.
