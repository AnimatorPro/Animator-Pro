Oops, did   was that an attatchment you sent?  Didn'     I can   don't know how to get
those over    through the modem.  Something about a marqi problem?

Anyways fixed the optics continu-move 1/4 rotate bug.  Was just
a missi     one line addition to the continue-move button function, pretty
localized.  Let's see if I can find the rest of e 'em.

We have found a little inconsistency with the buttons and I was 
wondering if you could take a look at them?

MASK BUTTON
-----------
1. create a mask
2. select use
3. select release
4. go to home panel - M is off
5. go to optics panel - it's on
6. click on M in optics panel
7. allows you to use the mask
8. go to home panel... it is still grey
9. click on M and it is locked up....

FIT BUTTON
----------
1. select cel/options
2. turn auto fit colors off
3. go to home panel
4. it is still highlighted on both home & optics panel......

fix.
