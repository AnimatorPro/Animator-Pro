Joining two flics with a Venetian Blind Transition lasting 175 frames or 
more will cause the program to pause for long periods of time while the join
is being rendered.  The length of the pause is longer when the number of 
frames in transition is higher.  This happens after the following steps:

1.  Load a flic, then select Join.
2.  Select Join to Start or End.
3.  Select Transition, then Venetian Blind.
4.  Set the number of Frames in Transition to 175.

The program will perform the transition, then appear to pause immediately 
after the transition for at least 1 minute before continuing through the 
joined flic.  The resulting flic plays normally.  

A pause will not occur when using a transition of 150 frames or less.

A transition of 200 frames will cause a 4.5 minute pause.  225 frames will 
cause a 6 minute pause.

(FIXED?)         BUG Report from VPAINT Database             BUG #   25724
When switching temp drives in response to the "Scratch Drive" 
error message while work is in progress, certain data and temp files are 
no longer available.

To recreate this bug, start with a drive for temporary files that is almost 
full (200-400k available), but not so full that the "Scratch Drive" message 
appears when entering the program.  Load a flic, draw polys and set tween 
start and end positions, clip a cel, and create an optics path.  Select 
use and render.  The "Scratch Drive (X): Only (X) Bytes Available" message 
appears, followed by the "Choose Drive for Temporary Files" menu.  Select 
a drive that has more than 1 meg available.  At this point all the poly, 
tween start and end, cel, and optics path buffers are empty.

I tried this test with both a hard drive and VDISK as the temp drive with 
the same results.  I also experienced garbled characters being displayed in 
the "Choose Drive For Temp Files" menu.
