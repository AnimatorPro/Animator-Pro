
Known Bugs in Shipping Version of Autodesk Animator (V295)

1.  On a machine with one floppy drive when user has switched to drive
    b by typing
		B:
	at the ms-dos prompt, program gets confused.  It shows and A: button
	on file requestor but no B: button.   Selecting the A: button causes
	the message 'insert disk A: in drive A:' message to be printed on
	top of picture.

	WORKAROUND:  If you've changed to B: on a one drive machine make
	sure you change back to A: before running Animator.

2.  When recording a macro and causing flic to be played with the
    keyboard command <down arrow>,  during use of macro the play
	doesn't take place.  Instead the menu flicker on and off for
	a while.

	WORKAROUND:  While recording a macro select play from the menu with
	mouse.

3.  Extremely deep directories (directory path 60 characters or so or
    longer) will confuse the program in the file requestor sometimes
	leading to cookie crashes.  Also causes ugliness on browse menu
	(path wrapping around screen).

	WORKAROUND:  Be semi-reasonable with your directory nesting.


4.	For some file types (not .FLI or .GIF) you don't get an error message
    when loading a bad file or saving to a write protected disk.

	WORKAROUND:  none known.


5.	F3 and F4 keys (to save a pen down point) don't get saved properly
	in a macro file.

	WORKAROUND: none known.


Quirks:

1.	Reset doesn't clear out your text, polygon, cel or swap screen 
	buffers.   When making testing macros it's best to to a
		del H:\AAT
	(presuming H: is your temp drive) before making the macro or
	before using one to insure the program is in the same state
	at the start of a macro playback.

2.  The drizzle tool replays as a macro a few pixels off from how it
    is recorded.
