Here are some of the plans for the last few changes (other than the beta
bug fixes) to go into Vpaint:

Stuff That Will Change	(probably by friday)

1. The arrows in the optics menu changed so the y arrows point up and down,
   the z arrows at a diagonal like in CyPaint.
   ~~~done -jk~~~

2. Some mechanism installed to deal with full ram-disks more gracefully.

3. Font name displayed in small font if it won't fit inside the
   draw tools text sub menu.
   ~~~done -jk~~~

4. Macro working _every_ time when there's a play in it somewhere.
   ~~~maybe done, think I caught it goof once but couldn't reproduce.
   Needs more testing. -jk ~~~

Stuff That Won't Change (and reasons why)

1. Info View and Kill not changing the filename currently in file selector.
   (I find most of the time I prefer it this way.  Also would add a
   few more bytes to program.)

2. Separate paths for each file type.
   (Think this would be two steps forward one step back in terms of user
   convenience and stuff.  If you do all your animation in one directory
   it would probably be nicer.  If on the other hand you tend to have
   a separate folder for each project it would be a pain.  Also would
   use about 500 bytes more (at least actually closer to 2000 bytes))
   ~~~On the other hand separate file names (as opposed to folders) would
   only take about 250 bytes.  Would still eliminate some common user
   errors.  Perhaps this should go into the 'after the cropper' list -jk

3. Underlay/overlay GIF's over multiple frames.
   (This can be achieved fairly easily by putting the GIF into the cel.
   Additionally this gives you the chance to double-check the key color
   is correct.  More than a little code needed to implement.)

4. View mask, grid, path in menu red.
   (Sometimes red will not show up.)

5. Optics size x/y having one set of buttons for mouse control,
   similar set for slider control.
   (It's consistent for these to be separate with the other moves.  Also
   they are really two different things.)

6. Adjust Circle aspect -
   (I prefer the perfectly symmetrical jaggies as they are now as being
   'rounder' looking.  The aspect ratio differs from monitor to monitor.
   Would prefer to do address this with oval.)

 7. Video merge - inserting animation immediately after current frame.
    (beyond scope of program.)

 8. Compass rose gradient direction control -
    (I want to keep the way horizontal, vertical, and line gradients
	stick to the shape being drawn.  They can always do a 2 step process
	onto the alt screen and then a scrape fill if finer control is
	desired.)

 9. Code overlays -
 	(Not necessary.  A complete QA nightmare.)

Stuff That Might Change After Cropper Is Done (but before April 1)

1. Summagraphics tablet support.

2. More brush shapes and get brush.

3. Post-processing color filter to make all palettes of animation the same.

4. Combine color maps without shuffling.

5. Toggle cursor coordinate display on and off.  More coordinate displays
   available in the first place.

6. Edge in tool.

7. 'true' brighten ink.

8. Remove arrow shape from segment bar.

9. More transition effects.

10. Circle tool or oval tool letting you draw a 'mac' style circle - one
    that is an oval, but with the axis always horizontal or vertical.

11. ~~~Separate ink strengths for each ink. -jk

12. ~~~A separate 'texture' and 'dither' button. -jk

13. ~~~Way to color cycle more than one at a time. -jk

14. ~~~Way to tell vpaint 'we want to make this flic run at 20 fps but
    play as much as possible like it does now (ie a way of judiciously
	inserting frames to make splicing and compositing flics with 
	different frame rates easier.  Would simply make both ends run
	at say a frame delay of 2.
