VP BUGS
(X = fixed; last housekeeping 3/14,v238
(o = Jim thinks they're fixed 4/18/88 v255)
(y = Sorry, that's just the way it works.  If want change put it on features
     list.)
(z = Is a bug but don't think it's worth fixing considering....)
(? = Non-reproducable.  Will try to fix it when can figure out how 
	 to repeat it.

v255

-    Arrow keys don't work in frames menu.
o    Go to mask menu.  Select 'clip' with the keyboard instead of mouse.
     Leaves a garbage box on your picture.
-    Bang wildly on down arrow and 'n' keys while recording a macro.
     Macro will lose sync on playback sometimes.   (Actually this bug
	 has been around for last 50 versions or so.  Tried to fix it about
	 5 times so far and always just make it worse.)
?    In zoom mode occassionally after a fill screen will flash horribly
     and machine lock up for about 1 minute.  Then all is well.  This
	 is a very erratic bug I haven't seen for about 3 weeks at all but
	 suspect it might still be around.  Never have been able to reproduce
	 it.

v253
O    Change RGB or HLS sliders on a color, then move to next
     frame without leaving palette editor: slider values remain
     the same although color slot in next palette is different.
?    Palette Value/Ramp: Does not accept key color as Stop color
     (tho does accept key color as Start color).
-    Crop effect works unpredictably with various inks.  Don't
     know if this is bug or feature, but I need to know what the
     process is here.  (E.g., gradient inks apply their pattern,
     glass seems to apply the key color in glass, emboss does its
     bit, but add doesn't seem to do anything, etc.)
-    On Lewis' AT, clicking on the F: drive button causes wild
     and erratic results.
o    Make a small text window with a large font.  Type some descenders
     (ie j's and g's).  Move around window.  Watch trail of descender pieces
	 muck up the screen (though gets cleaned up after finish moving window.)
o    Paste cel but do nothing else to frame.  Go to next frame.  Cel paste
     is lost!  (Showed up v250 or so.)
o    Set up a new cluster in palette editor (right click over active cluster).
     Now right click over matrix to copy a single color.  You'll see a
	 misplaced red color hilite box, and possible a grey one over the picture.
o    Make sure your time segment is a single frame.  Go 'loop segment'.
     Program hangs.



v246
o    Optics: Size Ratio number is not working.
o    Tile ink ignores [K]ey color clear setting.

v239
o    Frame range number box writes over Optics panel when F/S/A
     buttons are clicked from Optics panel.
o    Range buttons in Frames menu do not highlight (as Marks
     buttons do.)	

v236-238
-    Temp Drive alert gets lost if it can't access one of the
     drive in the range of active drives (like Eric's setup). 
     Also, does not show current temporary drive.
o    Inks lose their settings after a Tool change (e.g., select
     Box, adjust Dark ink to 20 with dither on.  Select Draw,
     then select Box, and Dark ink will be back to 50 with dither
     off.)
o    Menu lock-out: Select color Tint, right-click outside of MAX
     TINT PERCENT menu (or select Cancel) -- menu displays will
     not appear, though VP continues to function.  Press [Q] to
     quit, and reboot to normal.
o    Composite/Underlay opaque: Key color register is altered on
     Combine Colors and Use Overlay Colors.  Maintains key
     register on other two, but does a best fit on No Fit.
o    Optics: Spin/Center/Default doesn't work for poly and spline
     elements.
o    Color: Blend & Paste not greyed in Value menu.  (Get "Can't
     find vvtemp.ccl" message.)
y    Optics: Spin/Axis - the axis jerks around.  (Bug or
     feature?)
y    Unblue pastes key color.  (Shouldn't this work like Next
     Blue and restore image under blue?)	(No way it could work
	 like next blue.  Can be done over all...)
o    Paste Below ignores [K] button, always pastes opaque.
     (Noticeable with V Grad and other non-opaque inks.)

v209
o    Titling: Horizontally scrolling text wraps on itself if one
     end of the window is moved partially off the left or right
     side of the screen.
o    Optics: Spin Small sets the Move Z axis to 640, beyond its
     500 max. value.  (This is an old bug that was never
     documented.)

v195 
o    Initial display frame of incoming composite file uses
     register zero as clear instead of current Key color.
