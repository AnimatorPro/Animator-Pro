
A comment on the "+" function on the files panel; it's great for
saving files, but I find it annoying that it is not disabled for
"load" and "delete".  It will increment the selected file name
even when no action is taking place.  When you select "load" by
accident, and then "+", it moves it up and leaves a gap in the
sequence when you do save.
	Always glad to hear from you John.  I'll be keeping the 
	plus key as it is.  It'd be nice to have it do no action
	if the file load/save/etc actually got an error, but
	hard to code in a small space.   On the other hand
	it's very nice to use "+" when loading a sequence of
	numbered 'pic' files, or deleting the same after you've
	combined them into a flic.

Also, when you create a hundred or more files, they do not appear
in the file selector window in proper order.  "10" will be
followed by "100", "109" by "11", etc.
	This would be nice too, but would require a lot of intelligence
	on the part of the sort routine.  The '+' key starts with
	2 digit numbers because few projects run over 100 revisions.
	On the other hand it's pretty easy to end up with 100 still
	frames.  In these instances I'd suggest manually writing
	'file000' in the file requestor.  The + should keep things
	sorted until you break 1000 then.
