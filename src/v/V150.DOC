o - Fixed bug when in draw tools menu with Text hilit, go load/save text
    or load font and scroll-bars get whacky.

o - In optics negative turn numbers don't creep up one. 

o - Number requesters redone.  Hope you like them better.  They come with
    a slider and ok/cancel buttons.  Click outside is like a cancel.  You
	can still type in numbers outside of the sliders range - which are set
	to 100 if there's nothing else handy to limit the range (like the frame
	count in the jump to frame).

o - Reworked color packing a bit.  It used to have drastic problems with
    multi-frame operations and pictures that had less colors than it
	was told to pack to.  These are fixed.  Might have gotten the
	problem with garbage color generated sometimes in 'for ST or for Amiga'
	modes, but not sure.

o - Ado wire-frame preview timing includes to range to frame to all.

o - Underlay and cross-fade are back.   Underlay works more like Zoe underlay
    than it did before.  It's sensitive to inks too though.  Cross fade is
	like old cross-fade (ignores ink, is always somehow transparent).

o - Took out frame positioning for splice.  This isn't really easy to
    do here.  In the normal case I don't have to recompress but the
	transition frames, which makes things simpler and faster.


Video Paint 198

o - Curves and polygon closed/open/filled toggles working again.

o - Open spline paths ok.

o - After time range multi-segment stuff 'back-frame-cashe' is
    flushed properly.  (Avoids erratic garbage in frame that tends to
	disappear on replay.)

o - 3d spin center displayed.  (This isn't finished center/axis handling,
    but it's a start.)

Video Paint 197

o - Can abort FLI loads.

o - Put in a time range multi-frame routine about 2x as fast as old one.


Video Paint 196

o - Rearranged things so text and font in memory only when in text-tool,
    or when in draw tools menu.

o - Should no longer get complaint on startup of 'cant find gem6x6.fnt'
    if it cant.

o - Put in some 'back frame buffering'.  Back stepping and frame 
    recompression should be faster.  (Optical f/x to time range
	typically 5-50% faster, especially faster when range is 
	near end of file.)


Video Paint 195

o - Sampled and clocked paths implemented.

o - Tweened poly's in ADO don't go backwards now.

o - Time slider in timing menu doesn't leave your color map screwed up
    sometimes.

o - Time slider doesn't (visibly) replay from the 1st frame when stepping
    backwards.

o - Flood fill in zoom shouldn't go batty any more.

o - Fixed a few bugs where things didn't show up correctly in Zoom.

o - Loading Settings when in zoom mode doesn't crash out.

o - Got rid of annoying bells at end of line in text editing.

o - Tried to nuke a: b: bug in browse/file selector,  but it seems to have
    disappeared (from my machine at least) on it's own.  Please let
	me know if it recurs.

o - Zapped divide by zero if enlarge all the way at optics.


Video Paint 194

o - Some internal changes to keep polygons/splines in 3D internally.

o - Got polygon and spline paths basically working.


Video Paint 193

o - Fixed some 'refreshing from the undo buffer' in optical mouse moves.

o - Fixed some garbage left on display of mouse moves for splines & polys.

o - Changed mouse on flat optical menu to 'use' (which is equivalent to
    render.  Just a temporary measure.)

o - Axed 'action' pulldown in optics.

o - Put a files... item under presets.

Video Paint 192

o - You can now ado splines and polys.

Video Paint 191

o - Put Settings... into the system menu as a way to get a files menu with
    settings the default type.

o - Reused (tweened) polygons and splines will pay attention to ease in,
    ping-pong, etc.

o - Browse view faster coming back to menu after the view.  (Doesn't rescan
    all the fli's in the window, just saves out screen).

o - starting to add spline objects (not spline paths) to optics.


Video Paint 190

o - optical cels color fit.

o - Fixed bug where it would save bogus cel in a temp file sometimes when
    in fact there was no cel present, leading eventually to a 'temp.cel'
	truncated message.

o - Expanded menu button structure to include a disabled flag.  (So can
    grey out flat menu items.)

o - Switched 'S' (use stencil) for 8 (color 8 outline) on quick menu.

o - Changed names of temp files, and format of main fli temp. (Should
    be pretty transparent, but won't try to attatch to temps generated
	by earlier versions.)

o - on Files... menu font and text files are implemented.

o - Also on Files can load and save Settings  (basically your state  except
    for pixels and color map).

Video Paint 189

o - Added view alt and view frame.

o - Put 'alt' after all the alt selections.

o - Composite's follow ink types.

o - Removed most of compositing numbered choice menus.

o - Implemented auto color fitting of cel. (Doesn't work in opticals with
    cel though...).


Video Paint 188

o - Making stretch and rotate sensitive to inks.

o - Fixed a clipping problem that was crashing Lewis' Mac fonts.  (They
    has lots of zero width characters somehow).

o - Reworking fit colors so as to remap transparent ink properly.

o - Keeping magnetic copy of Cel so can use it for 'auto fit colors'
	and adapt the RAM copy to the local color map.  (Not actually doing
	auto fit yet.)

o - Making opticals sensitive to ink types.  Not running out of memory
    much.  I did some horrible things to avoid this that will probably
	cost me my membership in the programmers guild.  (Seriously just
	still more swapping to disk.)


Video Paint 187 

o - Implemented flip range (replay of time range).

o - Insert Tween - this is what I'm doing instead of 'History'.  It
    will create a frame between your current frame and the next.  The
	current frame shows up in blue (ink 1) and the next frame in ink 2.

o - Erase Guides - the equivalent of unhistory.

o - Next Changes is in.  (Reworked next blue so as to reuse some code.)



Video Paint 186

o - Paste Mask

o - Unblue Frame

o - Next Blue

o - Took out the slow part of the memory protection I put in.  (Just
    realized I allocate big chunks to decompress into during replay time.)
	Oh well, was a useful concept.  Found a latent bug in the ado with it
	(was still using some memory I'd told the heap was free.  The data
	...just happened... to not be overwritten by another heap allocation.


Video Paint 185

o - Reconnected stretch, rotate, and mask cel.

o - 'Texture' type of dither is set at 75% of what it used to be.  A bit
     slower (though now a slider control would be 'free'), but generally
	 nicer looking.

o - Fixed a nasty bug trashing memory when a numbered choice menu of greater
    than 8 items was called.  More often than not just caused NEXT program
	you ran after V to crash.


Video Paint 184

o - New menus are in place so that all old functionality (except fit colors)
    is back.  Mostly debugged, but has crashed a few times on exit
	on me.  (Power cycle time).

o - Load/save stencil.

o - Free cel.

o - File menu font, text, poly, and path don't work.


Video Paint 183

o - Stencil, macro and grid back in.  A still somewhat flaky files... menu
    in too.

Video Paint 182

o - Outlined filled polys shouldn't be missing an edge of outline any more.

o - New pulldown menu tree installed.  For moment stencil, macro, and grid
    operations are unavailable.  Most of auto is under 'video/effects'.

o - starting work (not visible yet) on files... menu.

Video Paint 181

o - Should run out of memory less.  2 reasons.
	I'm swapping out the alt screen etc more.
	Reduced compression-time memory requirements to be same as screen size.

o - Installing some even stricter software memory protection.  Should
    help make bugs more reproducable.  Along with your old favorite bad
	cookie messages you may see
		'Someone stomped on low memory!'
		'Heap in a bad way.'
		'Someone's stomping free memory!'
	Anyways these diagnostic routines themselves may have bugs.  In the
	long run though should help a lot.

o - reversed two lines of Time menu as per JP's suggestions.

o - fixed some Multiframe Options crashes.


Video Paint 180

o - All of Time menu but Adjust implemented.

Video Paint 179	

o - Changed quick menu s and e buttons into 8 and 0.  8 = 2 color.  0 =
    clear key color.

o - Starting time menu.  For now hung under Optical f/x.


Design issues - (just thoughts)

o - Working out new drop-down menu tree.

o - Designing a time menu.  Want it to include
		buttons to insert, delete, step frames, jump to first or last.
		A non-real-time frame index slider bar.
		Slider to adjust playback speed.
		The time range (segment) indicator.
		Ways to mark a frame for quick return.
		A couple of 'banks' of time ranges.
		A play time range button.
		??Access to animation on 2s??


o - Counted em up (roughly).  Vpaint has about 329 buttons.  Let's assume
    the final version has 500 buttons.  At 40 bytes eash that's  20000 bytes
	for the menu buttons.   In the light of this I'm not sure if it would
	be worthwhile to go to the substantial effort of recoding things to keep
	menus in disk files.  Figure it would only be about a 10K win in the end.
	Could add up to 3 weeks to the project.


Video Paint 178

o - Place text sticks better.

o - Can set menu colors from palette.

o - As a result of above menu colors are in temp.flx.  Please destroy old
    temp.flx and default.flx before running this one.

o - Added boxed option to separate.  Confines area of separate to a box.

Video Paint 177

o - Comes up with 1 frame.

o - If you have a file called 'default.flx' in your startup directory
	it will use this to determine configurations etc when you start
	with nothing in your ram-disk or answer 'no' to keep setting when
	selecting 'new'.  (This may even include starting out with non-blank
	screen(s).)   You get this file by selecting configuration/save settings.
	This will save the current vpaint state (pixels and colors included,
	so you probably want to do it to a blank 1 frame with your fave color
	map and favorite inks, tools etc in place).

o - Added mask to 'cel/transforms'.  Works pretty much like Zoe mask.

o - Separate reworked.  Now can separate  single/range/close.  Close
    is what used to be 'rgb'.  Default is now single.  Range like Zoe
	Separate Many (except still need a pen click to set it off.)

o - Added Paste Grid.

o - Fixed off by 1 problem in grid.

Video Paint 176

o - Put in a new multi-frame requestor in place of the old one that
    comes up to confirm an action over multiple frames.


Video Paint 175

o - In multi-frame mode a 'reuse' spline/poly will put the result over
    many frames, tweened from the original shape.

Video Paint 174

o - Curves 'draw tools' options reworked.  Have tension/continuity/bias
    sliders, and can do solid ones.

o - Vpaint just broke 200,000 bytes!

o - Reuse polygon/spline routines let you move around the vertices.


Video Paint 173

o - The new curves work in solid lines with brushes and inks.  

o - Curves and polys 'stick' better.  (Wasn't setting dirty frame.)

o - Put 'reuse' button on draw tool options for poly and curve.  1st step
    to an 'edit' function that lets you tweak around the points, sort of
	like the loop in Ani.

o - Expand x2 on auto-menu.  Does some pixel interpolation.



Video Paint 172

o - Got Tom's new Hermitian splines started into Vpaint.  The fixed point
    conversion's done already.  Looks good except splines are all dotted
	lines for now....

o - Palette functions load, paste, and ramp sensitive to multi-frame toggle.

Video Paint 171

o - All the palette remap functions are sensitive to multi-frame toggle.

o - Fixed some problems with undo in the color menu.

o - Default in palette menu remaps current frame.

o - Added 'use cel' to palette remaps.



Video Paint 170

o - Made 'bad cookie' routine change you back to old video mode.

o - Increased size of temp file to maintain program settings by about 200
    bytes.  You may have problems reading in old temp.flx files.

o - Disable 'Cel' option on 3D f/x if no Cel present.

o - Slightly tweaked brightness of greys in menus following Jack's suggestions.
	Bright color less bright.  Dark grey is lighter.

Video Paint 169

o - 3D should work in segment mode properly.

o - Implemented 'options' portion of 3D pull down system.  This includes
    switches to do it to the Cel or to the Frames.  Also can have the
	result outlined with current brush and current color, and select
	whether the key color is clear.

o - Left clicking outside of 3D menu takes you to mouse mode.

o - Implemented Load/Save 3D f/x.

o - Exit 3D selection works again.  (So does exit Palette).

o - In 3D f/x rotations aren't 'lost' as much when you exit the menu.

Video Paint 168

o - Renamed 3D F/X to Optical F/x.  Don't know if this will stick.

o - Mouse 'Y' button didn't used to work.  Fixed it.

o - Some internal changes so could share some code between Palette and 
    Optical F/X

o - Changed slider routine so something out of range shows up pinned to
    the edge of slider box instead of somewhere outside of box.


Video Paint 167

o - The mouse part of 3D f/x is well on the way.  No center is visible 
    which makes setting the center or axis with the mouse next to impossible.
	Good stuff though with turns, move, and size.  Path's going to wait until
	I get back to splines.

	This menu is still getting thrashed out a bit.  Most of it works now.
	Going to have to do something about big numbers and slider bars.  Oh
	well.  Have fun anyways.


Video Paint 166

o - 3D panel is starting to work.  Preview works.  The Zoetrope/Cyberpaint
    section save for paths is in there.  Haven't done the mouse moves
	yet.


Video Paint 165

New Features
	o - 3D panel is completely implemented as far as menu is concerned.
	    Menu rearranges itself properly when buttons on the left are
		pushed.  However still doesn't effect the ADO action.


Bug Fixes -
	o - When go to palette 1st time RGB sliders are correct instead of
	    0 0 0.

	o - Ink 0 hilights correctly on quick menu.

Video Paint 164

o - 3-d f/x runs out of memory less often.

o - More of the 3-d f/x panel menu is viewable if not necessarily selectable.

o - RGB sliders are un-reversed (red on top now) in palette.


Video Paint 163

o - Bug where sliders and buttons would show up off the menu or misplaced
    when you've moved the ink types or drawing tools menu is fixed.

o - Ink types are alphabetized.

o - Trails runs out of memory less.

o - Time segment is close to finished.  Can drag it around, page it
	and stuff.  Right clicking lets you move the ends individually.  Left
	clicking moves both ends of segment.

o - Bug where right clicking over ink types in ink types menu and menu
    gets pasted on your picture is well nuked.

Video Paint 162

o - Have display of time segment pretty much done.  Can't drag it around
    yet.  (Can change it with the arrow buttons though.)

o - Fixed bug in right clicking into ink types menu where it didn't reflect
	the type you clicked on when got back to fast menu.

o - Fixed bug where ink types would appear in draw tools slots after a
    'new' when you'd been in the ink types menu.


Video Paint 161

o - Right clicking to get into ink types menu also changes your ink type.

o - Selecting a file in browse makes that file's name show up on the
    normal 'text' file selector.

o - Starting work on the panel part of 3D f/x menu.


Video Paint 160

o - Ink types menu is in style of quick menu.  Effects quick menu's
    buttons too.

o - Can go 1 character's height below flop-down menu before it flops out
    of the way.

Video Paint 159

o - The latest rev of the quick menu.

Video Paint 158

o - Put in Tom Jeffries new and improved fake vblank routine.

Video Paint 157

o - No crashing when doing the old color copy in palette.

o - Macros should work with ado-preview.  


Video Paint 156

o - In 3d menu see 'test/mouser'.  Just experimenting with some mirage like
    2-axis movements.  (Is this pretty much what mirage does?  I need to take
	a closer look to see if they're doing 2 spins or 1 spin about a tilted
	axis.)

o - Shortened '+' in file requestor's effect to last 2 digits.  (ie get
    noname01.fli instead of nonam001.fli).

o - Check for existing devices on start-up.  Only show devices actually hooked 
    up in file requestor and browse.

I've been looking at Jack and Gary's 3-d f/x mock-ups and comments.  Right now
am pretty convinced to replace Zoom with Preview.  Want to have 'tween' and
'multi' in the drop-downs with one letter abbreviations on top line of menu.
Looks like mirage-style 'mouseball' 2-axis control will mean keeping 3 separate
'turns' numbers.  I'd really rather keep the titling effects separate from the
3-d for the moment.  Maybe it'd be possible to merge them later, but need to
establish how to handle scrolling and 'typing on' the text first.  

Let me know if the color copy bug still is there for you.  I've never seen
it that I can recall.






Video Paint 155

o - Put in thread in color map.  It attempts to turn your color map into
    a bunch of spectrums.  Surprizingly it often works.

o - Put in spectrums.  This is much like thread but a little better I
	think.


Video Paint 154

o - New color menu does everything old one does plus 'sort'.  Sort is
    only by luminence now.  The color palette pull-downs are going to
	be messed with a lot I think!


Video Paint 153

o - Started work on new color menu.  Currently prettier than old one,
    but bottom row of functions missing.  Planning on moving them up
	to a drop-down system soon.

o - Somehow undo in color palette seems fixed already.

o - Current ink color has a black and white dot on it if it's in the
    radient range.

o - Selecting a preset no longer screws with the options on 3d f/x.


Video Paint 152

o - 3D f/x menu is well on its way.  All motions are presets now,
	but ping-pong, ease in, and still (vs tween) now all work,
	and there are a few more presets than before.

o - Kill in browse works better.

Video Paint 151

o - No longer puts up DOS abort/retry/cancel message.  Was going to
    put up my own but it kept crashing.  Currently just always does
	a 'cancel'.

o - Started work on a pull-down based '3d Fx' menu.  (3d Fx = ADO).
    Still bug infested and not very functional.


Video Paint 150

o - Separate now lets you do a rgb type color separate rather than
    by color index.  Hit 'rgb' on the tool options menu when sep is
	selected.  The threshold controls how close colors have to be to
	the color(s) you've pen downed over before they're separated to
	the current color.  Separate from the pull-down uses whatever option
	you've selected from the tools menu.  Default is rgb on, 10% threshold.
	When in rgb mode the destination color is also color fitted frame
	by frame.  

o - Fixed a couple of places where the file requestor wouldn't show
    up in recognizable colors.

o - Fixed a bug in zoom logic that had a number of symptoms including:
		1. Separate from pulldown didn't work in zoom mode.
		2. A cancel response to 'over how many frames' requestor in
		   zoom mode would act like a 'to this frame' response.
