	o - Put in NOSAVE conditional compile in files.c, savefli.c, vpaint.c
		and jimk.h.  If NOSAVE is defined in jimk.h then the save
		features will be disabled.

Video Paint 341
	o - Took out $$$$$$$$$$ (serializer thing) from the about box.

Video Paint 340 (Oct 3, 1991)
	o - Added a couple of lines to init.c for aa and convert so that
		under DOS 5.0 they'd leave 8K unallocated as opposed to 4K.
		This seems to be necessary for PC-DOS 5.0.
	o - Changed "about" boxes to show version 1.02 and include 1991
		in the copyright.

Video Paint 339 (Aug 20, 1991)
	o - Changed makefiles so that include path is taken from environment
	    rather than hardcoded as c:\tc\include so build group will
		have an easier time.

Video Paint 338	(Feb 22, 1991)
	o - changed an "out 20h,ax" to "out 20h,al" in clock routine
		to make things work better under multimedia windows.

Video Paint 337
	o - Undid dirties() change to dauto() from v335.  (To
	    get rid of one-palette side effect.)

Video Paint 336
	o - Added following line to dopreview() so that fragments of your
	    latest changes don't show up as garbage on the preview.
				if (tr_frames > 1)
					scrub_cur_frame();

Video Paint 335
	o - moved dirties() call outside of switch in dauto(), and
		changed cleans() to dirty_frame = 0 also in dauto to have the
	    effect of making the "you've made changed you haven't saved"
		message appear more consistently.
	o - Rearranged things a bit in see_ado_poly() to make wireframe
	    preview of cel and flic work again.

Video Paint 334
	o - Changed 2 occurences of:
			if (time_ix == SCALE_ONE)
				time_scale = SCALE_ONE;
		to:
			if (time_ix == time_frames)
				time_scale = SCALE_ONE;
		in auto.c to fix the bug I claimed I fixed on 333.  Sorry,
		sort of a mental typo here.  Must have hit one of those
		wierd cases when it worked otherwise in my  quick test of 333.
		This passes the 3 test's Cindy put in /usr6/jkent/public/tweenbug.doc
		anyways....

Video Paint 333
	o - Further changes to ease-in and ease-out.  The previous fix
		seemed to work for the 1st frame, but not the last.  This
		one works with the last as well.

Video Paint 332
	o - Changed ease-in and ease-out code to pass 0 through unchanged
	    therefore makeing the code I changed in v331 apply in these
		situations too.  Tested with optics and tween.  This one has
		few potential side effects outside the ease-in and ease-out
		operations themselves.  Doesn't effect any static data structures.
		Indeed the fix amounts to inserting the lines:
			if (scale == 0)
				return(0);
		in two places.

Video Paint 331
	o - Changed tween code so that 1st frame will draw 1st end of
	    tween exactly, and likewise for last frame (unless complete
		is off).
		Most likely place for side-effects to this change would be in
		the tween system itself or possibly in optics.  Looks clean
		here though.

Video Paint 330
	o - Rearranged some arithmetic in  calc_path_pos() which will
	    have the effect of making tweens/paths a little more accurate.
		(Check this with LARGE polys for possible overflow.)

Video Paint 329
	o - More tweening changes.  If max point count of both polygons is
	    6 or less it does tween the old  (v295 release) way.  (This
		is 'cause we have a triangle to square illustration in the manual.)

Video Paint 328

Changed to code:
	o - minor modifications to the way xform_to_ado_poly(), ado_calc_poly(),
	    and tween1() to improve tweening between closed/filled shapes
		with differing point counts.
			Some notes on the algorithm:  In general this tweening
			algorithm cannot provide an exact match to both ends
			of the tween.  The end with more points will be an
			exact match.  The end with less points may be a little
			off.  If the pt-count of one end is an exact multiple
			of the other things should match perfectly.  If
			the pt-count of one end is quite large the match should
			be close, off by one or two pixels here and there perhaps.
			The worst case is tweening between 2 polys with different
			but small pt-counts, say between a triangle and a square.
			The triangle will have an end chopped off.   This is
			a design limitation sadly, not a missing line of code or
			typo.


Video Paint 327

Changes to code:
	o - In optics menu replaced 2
			clear_form(render_form);
		with
			color_form(render_form,vs.inks[0]);
		so as to make flic element operations with key color not zero
		work better.

Video Paint 326

Changes to code:

	o - Gave the 'm' button it's own little seeme function
	    which will disable itself when appropriate.  Fixes
		problem where 'm' was not greyed out in Time Select
		and Optics menus. Took code out of home menu background 
		button that used to do this for the home menu.  Also made feelme
		functions of the 'm' buttons on the other menus same
		as on the home panel.  Should make no difference.
		Total change: about 10 lines of code.


		(Impact on testing - not too severe.  Regressions if
		any should be limited to the mask system.)


	o - Added following line of code to start of do_move_along()
		to get rid of "1/4 turn in y no wire-frame continue-move"
		bug:
				make_rot_op();

		(Impact on testing - test continue-move for regressions.
		Unlikely there will be a problem.)

Video Paint 325

Changes to code:
	o - In the frames menu *2 *3 *5 code I moved  the test for more
	    than 4000 frames out of the insert frame loop.  This is to
		fix bug 25726.
	o - Revised yes/no box after full temp drive select to make
		no take you back to the temp drive requestor.  This is
		because 'no' is easier to hit (right click or space will do
		it) than 'yes', and the user should be forced to  make a
		concious choice about this.
	o - Check return value of sub_cur_frame inside composite loop.
	    This fixes the looping 'no room on temp drive' error message
		in bug 25737.  The losing buffers in less reasonable conditions
		problem goes a little deeper.   Don't think I can fix this
		part easily without breaking some other things.
	o - Wrote a new function to verify that a file was a poly/path
	    file and check this when loading polygons or paths.
		New error message if it's not.  "Not a polygon/path file".
		Fixes bug 25738.
	o - Changed arithmetic in true_fades() and true_blend() routines
		from 16 bit to 32 bit.  This is to fix bug 25725. (Please
		verify join/transition/fade out and join/transition/dissolve.
		I suspect the old way fade out would have broken at about
		2048 frames. The circle/venetian/wipe/dissolve transitions
		all use the true_blend() routine.  Fade out uses true_fade().)
	o - Added 2 spaces at the end of formatting string in box_coors()
		routine.  This should fix bug #25732.
	o - Removed a line of code from get_filename() I had put in last version
		(324) that really wasn't needed and had a side effect of producing
		bug #25733.
	o - jdelete_rerr() passes back an error status and browse_action()
		uses this status to see whether to disappear the file to fix
		bug #25735.
	o - do_copy_overs() will delete a temp file if it isn't successfully
	    copied to the new temp device when changing temp devices.
		This changes bug 25736 to something more palatable.  (Cel, Alt,
		etc buffers may be lost but otherwise program should behave
		itself.)

	This is still open from v324.
	(Hard to reproduce.  I fixed a  couple of  bugs I came across looking
	to  reproduce this one, but this particular one I couldn't get to 
	happen. Could Cindy J note down the memory Vpaint reports with
	Extras/info  when this  one happens? )

Video Paint 324

Changes to code:
	o - Fixed a bug in the error message handler that crept in between
	    v321 and  v323.  Fix amounted to adding one  line of code  and
		got rid of bugs # 25712,25717, and 25731.
	o - Made it so if program didn't have enough memory to save the
	    area behind a menu, the menu doesn't come up.  (Program used
		to cookie crash out in these situations.)  Now it puts up an
		out of memory box if it has enough memory to save the area
		behind the out of memory box.  <grin>
	o - If the cel/alt/mask buffers are on disk instead of ram when
	    the "select scratch drive" requestor comes up you don't
		lose them (which is to say the program makes an attempt to
		copy them to the new disk.  If there's no room there you still
		lose them.)   Addresses bug 25730.

Status of latest QA bugs:
(FIXED) 25712 - Write protect error screwed up.
(FIXED) 25717 - More write protect error  screwed up.
(OPEN) 25726 - Frames Bar displays pos/neg nos. after clicking Mult Frame
	(I couldn't reproduce this.  It bears resemblence to a bug fixed last
	version.  Could you make sure it's still there and get back to me?
	This one requires you render 3999 frames. Sigh.)
(OPEN) 25728 When "out of memory" msg appears, can't get out of loop;
	get lost clsters
	(Hard to reproduce.  I fixed a  couple of  bugs I came across looking
	to  reproduce this one, but this particular one I couldn't get to 
	happen. Could Cindy J note down the memory Vpaint reports with
	Extras/info  when this  one happens? )
(NAB) 25729 Current flic is lost when trying to load a flic too large 
	for temp drive.
	(This is  what's supposed to happen.  It deletes  the current flic
	before loading in the new one so there  will be space for the
	new one when it  arrives.   The user has committed to  losing
	his current flic at this point anyways.)
(FIXED) 25730 - Cel and swap screen buffers are cleared when returning to
	 after an unsuccessful optics render.
(FIXED) 25731 - Saving a flic while VDISK file creation error exists 
 	gives no error msg.

Video Paint 323

Bug Fix:
o - The 'numbered choice menu' code has been made re-entrant (so that
    it can be called from inside itself.  The only places this used
	to happen is when you ran out of temp-drive space doing a
	"pentools/poly/tween/do tween" or a "mask/paste over many frames".
	(Fixes bug #25720)

Other Notes:
	Program currently leaves you with 1K less free memory on startup than
	the first release (v295) did.  The size  of the disk file is about
	500 bytes larger.

	Tentatively I've classified #25715 as NAB.   I could force the
	cross-fade to always start with the incoming fli in the upper left.
	Then again the way it is now doesn't  really hurt anything, and
	concievably someone could find a use for it.

	#25711 (the ambiguous/erronious error messages) is probably not
	fixed to everyone's complete satisfaction, but is better.
	Note that the extra error information is only available under
	dos 3.0 or higher.  Would appreciate you testing it under 2.0
	to make sure it doesn't crash.

Video Paint 322

o - When you change temp drives to one with less than 200000 bytes free
    a warning dialog appears and asks you to pick another drive.

o - When changing temp drives you don't lose your text, polygon, tween,
    optics, optics path, and macro. (#25724)

o - Long browse paths shouldn't leave garbage characters on browse menu.
	(#25709).  Also you'll see the end of a long path rather than the
	beginning.  (I think this is more useful.)

o - Directory names bigger than 63 chars  are handled in 
	browse like they are in the file requestor.  (Ie
	an error dialog instead of eventual crash.) (#25716)

o - Huge filled tween polys don't cause looping error message in
    do-tween  (#25714)

o - Fixed a bug introduced in v314 that made the current font revert
    to system at the drop of a hat....

o - Expanded errors that are explicitly reported by DOS 3.0 a bit.
    "Cannot make directory entry."  and various network errors
	are the main new ones.  (Partial fix to #25711).

o - Previews with not enough room on temp drive don't leave the
    last frame of the preview where your picture should be.
	(Fixes #25718 among others.)

o - Fli's longer than 4000 frames can't be created. (#25719)
	(It used to be possible to create fli's up to 4351 by
	the methods in Cindy Jeung's bug #25719 or simply by 
	first creating a 4000 frame fli, then saving it out,
	and then setting frames slider to 4351.)  Fix involved
	testing for 4000 every time an insertion is made, not just
	when a bigger index table was needed.  (On fli load/save an
	index table roughly 356 frames bigger than currently needed is
	constructed.)

o - In optics  with full temp file 'use' doesn't remove your
    cel and/or alt screen.

o - When there's not enough room on temp drive to save changes to
    current frame  changes to that frame are discarded cleanly
	(rather than remaining in parts until you go back to frame #1).

o - Saving picture without a .GIF extension is  possible. (#25721)

o - Venetian transition joins of > 175 frames work better. (#25723)



Video Paint 321

o - Long directory names don't make browse path get overwritten.
	(#25709)

o - Reworked disk error reporting.  Should fix #25711 & 25712

o - Loading a file too big to fit on temp device doesn't cause
    64K of memory to be lost.

o - Optics/path aborts more gracefully when temp drive is full.

o - Browse/view aborts rather than trashing pic when temp drive is full.


Video Paint 320

o - New error message - "Shape too big to fill".
	(Fixes #25704,25705,25706)

o - New error message - "Directory name too long".
	(Fixes #25708)

o - "Set frame count" to a number less than the current frame you're on
	doesn't cause a spurious 'file corrupted' message.
	(Fixes 25707).


Video Paint 319

o - Error messages  that come up during preview are  visible.

o - Filled polygons too big to scan convert are not drawn at all rather
    than shown in outline.

(These should address the last 4 bugs Cindy.   At some point in an optics
negative z move  your poly may disappear.  Think of  it as  going behind you.
Huge filled shapes (bigger  than 1000x512 say) can't be drawn due to
limitations in the scan conversion routine.)

Video Paint  318

o - Made  tweening  system handle tweens  between polygons of different
    sizes.    This came to me  as a bug report.  Though at release it
	was considered a design limitation,  it's  something I'd been
	planning to put into PJ anyways.  Worked out a fairly simple
	algorithm that does the job in  about 300 bytes.  Tweening shapes
	is now  possible if you're a little careful to draw them so  that
	the starting points are in good correspondence, and  both are
	clockwise (or  both counterclockwise).


Video Paint 317

o - Changed copyright notice to include 1990

Video Paint 316

o - Small bug with looping 'shape too big' message in optics with
    move z = -500 fixed.

Video Paint 315

o - Deleting an optics file gives you ".opt" instead of ".3dx" suffix.

o - Deleting a file that doesn't exist brings up appropriate error
    message.

Video Paint 314

o - In Draw Tools under spline and poly, 'tween' and 'redo' are greyed
    out if there's no poly/spline defined yet.

o - In Draw Tools under Text, save is greyed out when no text exists.

o - When you try to load a font file that doesn't exist program behaves
    better.  Please test this a lot.  Had to make a fair bit of changes.
	(If you load a font file that exists, but isn't good you'll
	end up with 'system.fnt' after the error messages.

o - Appropriate 'file not found' and 'overwrite old' dialogs inserted
    where missing for various file types.

o - In files... menu button 'save' is greyed out properly for font, 
	polygon, record, and text.

Video Paint 313

o - Move spline off to the right 500 in optics bug fixed.  (Actually
    this is just postponed.  Should break at 4000 now.)


Video Paint 312

o - Changed dialog you get on right click over delete in frames... to
	'How many frames to delete?' - which is small enough to fit.

Video Paint 311

Oops:  Version and copyright date didn't quite get made in last one.


Video Paint 310

Bug Fixes:

o - *5 in frames menus doesn't make you continue out of error message
    3000 times.  (Once will do.)

Other changes:

o - Took strokes/session line out of info continue box.

o - Updated version and copyright date in about box.

Video Paint 309

Changes:

o - Changed bad cookie error message to:
   Internal error.  
   Please see Appendix B of Autodesk Animator Reference Manual. 

o - #ifdef'd out Wacom tablet related stuff.

o - Removed sep 2-part.

o - Fixed 32 point petal reuse-spline bug.

o - Circles and disks are rounder.

o - The right click on drawing space to return to that panel message has
    the name of the panel in place of that.

Video Paint 308

BUG FIXES:

o - Moving one line text cels with cursor at the end doesn't make
    text window scroll a line.  (Changed a > to a >= in past_window() in
	textedit.c)

o - Control C while saving a GIF file after 'break on' executed
    from command line before starting animator doesn't break you
	out of program.  (A ^C still get's printed to the screen.  I
	don't know how to fix this.)

o - Made Wacom driver dynamically sense the minimum/maximum pressure
    the tablet's sensing today.  (It varies with the weather and
	from tablet to tablet.)  

o - When you change from Wacom pressure sensitive to mouse, spray isn't
    stuck on low setting until program exit.

Video Paint 307

o - Fixed some 'ancel' that should be 'Cancel' side effects.

o - Fixed broken sep near.

o - Fixed missing end of comment in summa.c

Video Paint 306

o - Hacking on sep.c and options.c to put in new separate option 2-part.

o - Made file commonst.c for strings like "Cancel" that are used in
    many files just to save a little memory.

o - Missed one string in csort.c.  It's in csort.str now.

o - Added Metamorphic system.  (It's conditionally compiled and
    consists of only new files, no modifications to old files.  This
	is experimental, and more likely to end up in PJ than Video Paint)

Video Paint 305

Internal Changes:

o - Separated out strings that'd need translation if it were to go
    into french, german, etc into .str files that are included in
	the .c file with the same name.

Video Paint 304

Features Changes:

o - Took out VIP code.  Interesting experiment, but think will cause
    more trouble than it's worth for the moment.

Internal Changes:

o - Commented summa.c and tablet.c a bit.

Video Paint 303

BUG FIXES:

o - Took out some unused code & potential bugs in vip handling.

o - Made Summa and Tablet drivers respond a little better when cable
    is unplugged.


Video Paint 302

Features Changes:

o - Have loadable input devices.  Not ADI, just VIP, which is something that's
	_almost_ a .exe file I've been working on for a while.  This may not
	be a permanent addition to the lo-res animator, but I'm playing around
	with it.  Got a Wacom pressure sensitive VIP, one for the mouse with
	buttons reversed, and straight mouse as samples.  Only adds about 2K code.


Video Paint 301

FEATURES CHANGES:

o - If using Wacom tablet, cursor stays in place if stylus out of proximity
    instead of going to lower left.

o - Refined pressure sensitive spray a little.  Gets wider as well as faster
    when you press hard.

BUG FIXES:

o - Fixed Paste Under which broke about v299.

Video Paint 300

NEW FEATURES:

o - Added in support for Wacom 2 digitizing tablets.  If you are using
    a pressure sensitive stylus the spray speed, gel width, and drizzle
	width respond to how hard you press.

BUG FIXES:

o - If you have 1000 or so files in your directory the file requestor
    scroll bar doesn't get confused.


INTERNAL CHANGES:

o - Added 'strokes' and 'session' fields to fli file header.  Strokes
	is total count of changes made to file.  Session is changes since
	file was loaded.  It's designed for administrative purposes and 
	hopefully in the future to warn user when he's about to use a 
	lot of work by loading a file without saving what's in memory, 
	or overwriting an old file.



Video Paint 299

FEATURES CHANGES:

o - Insert key will insert a single frame.  Delete key delete a single
    frame (from home screen or frames menu).

o - "Internal error.  Please note what you have done and call Autodesk support."
    appears after a bad cookie message.

o - F2 key will play animation as well as down arrow.  (Especially useful
	when no mouse and down arrow coopted for cursor movement.)

o - Changed error message when going around in circle in menu system a little
    to:
		"Right click on the drawing screen",
		"to return to that panel.",

INTERNAL CHANGES:

o - Moved checking against render_xmin/ymin/xmax/ymax back to render_dot
    from render_bitmap_blit.  (all in render.c).  (Saves about 100 bytes
	this way and ends up you have to clip in render_dot anyways.)




BUG FIXES:

o - Macro file closed on program exit if it is being recorded.

Video Paint 298

BUG FIXES:

o - Text behaves better when you type in characters that aren't in the
	font.  Might work better with 8 bit (international) fonts.  
	Multiple changes from signed to unsigned char in rfont.c to do
	this.  Also gftext() routine was missing check for characters less
	than 1st character in font.
	(Please run this by the European folks.  I haven't figured out
	how to generate 8 bit characters from my keyboard to test this.)

o - Can no longer go in circles in menus from palette to time select
    back to palette,  or from time select to frames to time select,
	or in circles involving the frames menu.
	This gets rid of some problems including a cookie crash on the
	palette to palette loop.   Implemented by putting a flag lock to avoid
	recursion in palette() in palet2.c, in multimenu() in multimen.c,
	and in do_time_menu() in timemenu.c.

o - Zero radius radial gradient divide error bug fixed.  (In drawmode.c
	set_rad_center().)


Video Paint 297

INTERNAL CHANGES:

o - Moved checking against render_xmin/ymin/xmax/ymax from render_dot
    to render_bitmap_blit.  (all in render.c).

o - Moved dwdot() inside of render_dot

o - Made dwdot into a table lookup for y start address (new routine
    make_lookups() in window.c and simplification of end of
	render_dot() in render.c).  Cumulative result of speed tweaks
	is nearly 2x speed improvement in opaque ink (lesser in more complex
	inks.)

o - Made dwgetdot a (very short) macro.

o - Added stuff_bytes to peekpoke.asm.

o - Made on_menus() a very short macro.  (Speeds up cursor in zoom
    significantly, and rubberbanding routines too.)

INTERNAL CHANGES:

o - Made some more globals static.

o - Moved some functions from one file to another to make yet more stuff
    static.

o - Started making prototypes for everything.

o - Put back in -Z flag

o - Removed some unused debugging code (poke_bg, flash_red, etc.)

o - Some global name changes:
	struct poly  ->   Poly
	struct flicmenu -> Flicmenu
	struct vcel -> Vcel
	struct vscreen -> Vscreen

o - Made prototypes for all global functions and compiled with them,
    finding a couple of missing parameters etc. as below.

BUG FIXES:

o - Latent bug in dtextcel() in textwind.c - a missing final 0 parameter -
	is nuked.

o - Latent bug in twirl1() in a3d.c - missing parameter to need_fit_cel.

o - Latent bug in dall() in auto.c - missing parameter to uncompfli.

o - Latent bug in bluesome() in blue.c - int i should be unsigned i.

o - Latent bug in finish_stretch_cel() in stretch.c -
	missing parameter to need_fit_cel.

Video Paint 295 (changes integrated with Peter so far) (RELEASE VERSION)

INTERNAL CHANGES:

o - Took out the -Z optimization flag since this looks to be the
    release version, and was not tested enough with it in.  (-Z
	does some register optimization that Borland recommends
	"you be careful with" since in certain bizarre circumstances
	it can lead to errors.)


Video Paint 294

BUG FIXES:

o - Gel brush in opaque mode doesn't have horizontal lines through it.


Video Paint 293

BUG FIXES:

o - When your optics move includes a path, this gets removed by reset.
	  (qreset_seq() in vpaint.c)

o - Tween state gets cleared by reset.  (qreset_seq() in vpaint.c)

o - Latent bug by ctint1() not explicitly returning a 1 is fixed.
	(fixed in Peter's already.)

Video Paint 292	(changes integrated with Peter so far...)

INTERNAL CHANGES:

o -  Using -Z flag in compiler to save about 3K.

BUG FIXES:

o - Real time macros play closer to timing recorded at.  Used to be
   almost 2x too slow.

Video Paint 291

FEATURES CHANGES:

o - Small change in pti_input in marqi.c to make macro files about 30% smaller
   on average.  (clickonly flag set...)

o - Random seed is saved in state file so macros will duplicate more
    precisely after a reset....

BUG FIXES:

o - Optics settings are completely cleared after a 'reset'.


Video Paint 290

BUG FIXES

o - Fixed broken autorepeat on slider arrows during macros that was
    side effect of last fix.

Video Paint 289

BUG FIXES

o - Attempts at correcting a problem with macros including a playback.

Video Paint 288

BUG FIXES

o - A little more error checking during initialization of mouse to
	get rid of a hang under dos 2.1 when no mouse driver installed.

Video Paint 287

BUG FIXES

o - Small changes to browse.c and filedata.c so that long directory names
	(like 12345678.DIR) don't leave bits of the last character hanging
	outside of where it's supposed to be on the menu.


Video Paint 286

FEATURES CHANGES:

o - Took out extended credits in about box.

INTERNAL CHANGES:

o - Removed some unused code from cblock.asm (xordot), tblit8.asm (tcopy_bytes),
	and int.asm (cpoke).


Video Paint 285

BUG FIXES:

o - Doing a 'join' when not enough room on temp drive will not make
    you do a cancel for each frame left in the join.  (One will do...)


FEATURES CHANGES:

o - Moved spacing of serial number on about box to look prettier.


Video Paint 284

FEATURES CHANGES:

o - The About Animator box has a place for a visible serial number and
    a type 4 sentinel there.

Video Paint 283

BUG FIXES:

o - 22264 Can cancel from puck/stylus Summa menu without adverse effects.

o - 18999 *2 frames from end then delete from middle bug gone.
	(Check all insert/delete *2 *3 etc. operations)

o - One frame cross fades don't die of a zero divide...

FEATURES CHANGES:

o - Added a continuation to the about box that lists who did what (of the
    people who spent hundreds of hours on this product that is.)

Video Paint 282

BUG FIXES:

o - 22265 Small change to key equivalents for drive buttons in file
    requestors.  Fixed a bug where if you've got a-g and i but
	no h, the key equiv for i didn't work.  (It was getting
	intercepted by an 'i' key equiv for a button that was disabled
	further on....)

o - 22207 If you include a B: in the _file_ field on a machine with
    no B: drive no longer get DOS message.  (This was fixed once for
	the B: button, again for B: in the _dir_ field, and again now.)

o - 24505 "Disk full or write-protected" error message changed to
    "Disk write-protected?"

o - 22267 Toggling off ink in Optics or Time Selector doesn't screw
    up the ink strength and dither settings.

o - 22268 Selecting file: on file requestor doesn't erase left edge of
    file name button.

o - 24504 2 color filled circles fixed.

o - 22269 Strings too long to fit inside of a continu or yes/no box
   no longer end up trashing screen.

o - 22270 Long file names that scroll in the file requestor don't overwrite
    bits of memory leading to load not responding in files... menu.
	(strncpy substituted for strcpy)

o - Typing file name as long as it can go doesn't give bad cookie on ok.


Video Paint281

BUG FIXES:

o - 24507 - 'Not a VGA/MCGA display' error message should be more
    visible.

BUG NOT FIXES:
o - 24506  I tried this - saving and loading macro to a floppy disk.
    Seemed to work fine. 

Video Paint 280

BUG FIXES:

o - Key equivalents for drive buttons work much better on machines without
    a B: drive.  

Video Paint 279

NEW FEATURES

o - In the browse menu hit 'p' to select play mode.  Then double click on
    file icon.  It plays in loop mode.  (I had to sneak this in.  Need one
	really useful but completely undocumented feature.)  Look for side
	effects in the 'view' mode.  (I haven't found any.)

o - New key equiv's in browse:
		l - load
		v - view
		i - info
		d - delete

BUG FIXES:



Video Paint 278

FEATURES CHANGES

o - Changed error message "file isn't 320x200, use crop to convert it" to
	"file isn't 320x200, use Autodesk Animator converter.".  This comes
	up when you try to load a GIF file of a different resolution.

o - Added "Disk full or write protected" to Can't create error message.

o - "aatmpflx.fli truncated" changed to "not enough room on temporary drive."

o - "Not enough space on scratch drive" changed to "not enough room on
     temporary drive."

o - "file mangled" changed to "file corrupted".

o - "Bad magic!  Not a fli frame" changed to "file corrupted."

o - "Macro truncated, aborting..." changed to
	"Macro file truncated.".

o -  "Too many colors, try less frames." changed to
	"Too many colors, try fewer frames."

Video Paint 277

FEATURES CHANGES:

o - On selecting extras/configure/input/summa you now get asked
    whether it's a puck or a stylus.  If you say puck the left and
	right buttons are swapped from what they used to be.

o - Moved date on about box.

Video Paint 276

FEATURES CHANGES:

o - The about... box is like the lawyers want it.

Video Paint 275

BUG FIXES:

o - Width/height coordinates of text box are correct.

o - Cel doesn't end up off screen after a stretch that involves a flip.
    Fixing this bug involved switching back to the old way of saving
	the cel movement.  Now once again any movement during a stretch or
	rotate is not reflected in the cel's position for the next move or
	paste.

Video Paint 274

BUG FIXES:

o - Grid coordinates when creating a grid are 1 less than they used to be
    in the width/height coordinates.  

o - Composite, and cel paste don't show you moving 1 pixel when you haven't.

o - Cel paste initial (dx dy) coordinate pair (the right one) isn't garbage
    until you click anymore.

Video Paint 273

BUG FIXES:

o - If you have a bad file where one of the frame headers is off, after
    the 'mangled' message program will recover more often.

o - Grid create doesn't seem to be off by one anymore.

o - Last character in type on titling really gets typed on. (18994)


FEATURES CHANGES:


Video Paint 272

BUG FIXES:

o - If you type in say Z: as your directory and don't have any Z: drive,
    the button hiliting should be correct after vpaint figures out
	there's no such drive.

o - Canceling out of time select when doing a use cel in palette editor
    doesn't grey out use cel for next time. (22234)

o - Gel brush lands in right place when you hit F4. (22235)

o - Canceling out of an composite that alters color map doesn't
    leave color map altered. (22236)

o - Right click in loop segment during macro hopefully never hangs. (22223)

o - Asterisk on use mask doesn't disappear when you do release mask. (22238)

o - Palette files are checked a little more thoroughly for errors. (22240)

o - Doing a enlarge with slider at 1 and Flic the optics element no
    longer causes cookie crashes.  You should get a 'shape too big'
	error message instead.  (22241)

o - Going to optics when home menu isn't up lets you have menu bar in
    optics these days. (22242)

o - Flic/backwards leaves you with the color palette much less confused
    if there's more than 1 palette in the FLI. (22243)


FEATURES CHANGES:

o - 'Reset to default flix' changed to 'Reset to default.flx'.
	(22215)

o - 'Save current settings' changed to 'Save default.flx'.

o - Grey spelled like Americans do it - Gray - in gray ink and effects/
    grays only. (22237)


OTHER NEWS:

o - The tint all to color 3 63 15 and the resulting greenish palette is
    considered not a bug.  Normally Vpaint will try to draw it's menus
	in the colors available.  If it detects the result would not be
	visible then it will take over the last 5 colors.  In this case the
	results are still visible (though tinted green), so vpaint makes
	due.  It does look a little funny, but there's not much I can do
	that wouldn't make it worse. (22233)

o - The palette files and mask files are interesting in that they are
    straight binary information with no header.  The good thing about
	this is it takes very little code to maintain them.  The not so
	good thing is I can't really tell if a given file is what it
	claims to be or not.   In spite of this since a bad palette file
	can do nasty things to vpaint if the rgb entries are not in the
	range from 0 to 63, I changed things so this is checked before
	the palette is accepted.  

	The design of vpaint is to encourage people to use predefined file
	suffixes, but not to force them to.  Particularly in the case of
	text files, it's very clear that it's nice to have a choice of
	suffix.  In all the other cases though it turns out to be mostly
	a hassle.  Oh well.  I'm not going to change it now.
	(22240)

o - The optics large enlarge bug fix had some rather broad ramifications
    I'm afraid.  It would be a good idea to make sure everything still
	works over multiple frames.

o - The 'Edit a .FLI with the Norton Utilities and sometimes it crashes'
    bug is stretching things a little.   Go edit the .EXE and it'll
	crash even sooner!  Seriously if the file system doesn't keep
	data intact then we're all dead or working with an Amiga.  Vpaint
	recovers from truncated files, or files that are named '.FLI' but
	are not in fact .FLI's.     If you _really_ want me to keep a 
	software CRC check or some other error detection (which is done
	in hardware anyway by the disk controller!) put in on the wish
	list for 1995.  By then we should have microprocessors fast enough
	people won't curse it for being slow.  (22243)

Video Paint 271

FEATURES CHANGES:

o - Left click off menu in color palette gets color.

BUG FIXES:

o - Typing B: into the directory line of file requestor on a machine
    without a B: drive shouldn't hang the machine.
	(22207)


Video Paint 270

BUG FIXES:

o - New text routines handle 1 line windows much better.


Video Paint 269

BUG FIXES:

o - Typing in the middle of a bunch of text in the text editor doesn't
    cause your text to re-word-wrap itself when text is pasted or moved.

INTERNAL CHANGES:

o - textedit.c completely rewritten.  Saved about 1.5K.  The design is
    a lot more solid now, but we should put the text editor through some
	thorough testing.   Much of wordwrap.c deleted.


Video Paint 268

FEATURES CHANGES:

o - 'Back' is changed back to 'Swap'.  's' key equiv. is removed from code.
   'b' is back in as toggle brush.

o - Input device and clock configuration are asterisked to show their current
    state.
	(22229)

BUG FIXES:

o - Paste mask doesn't deposit garbage when no mask is defined.
	(22226)

o - 2-key equivalents don't actually call their action routine if
    option they represent is greyed out.
	(22227)

o - 2-key menu keyboard equivalents on home screen show menus greyed out
    properly.
	(22228)

o   right clicking over move menu button on titling menu moves
    titling menu to bottom. 
	(18992)

o   When invoke a file requestor from the draw tools menu and come back
    to draw tools menus via poly files, there's no garbage when you 
	click the scroll bar. 
	(18993)

o   Loading a non-existent palette no longer gives message 
	"Color Fit Screen?"       
	(22231)

o   If you select different comm ports for the tablet more than once in
    a session asterisks are not repeated in choices.
	(jk)

o   Reworked handling of not being able to open main scratch file
    (aatemp.flx) on program startup.   It should come up and say
	'having trouble with drive D:'  (if D: is the non-existent scratch
	drive).   Then you'll get a 'choose drive for temp files' dialog.
	If you cancel out of this one you're out of the program too.
	If you for some reason change it to a drive that is not suitable
	(no free space, read only) you should come back to the
	'having trouble with...' alert.
	(22230)

o   BRWS: Clicking on top line of Browse panel generates screen garbage.
	(22222)

o   aatemp.flx file truncated message would appear in wierd colors
    sometimes when loading a file too big to fit into scratch drive.
	This is fixed.
	(jk)

INTERNAL CHANGES:

o   Made everything possible in file textedit.c static in preparation
    for rewriting file.  Looks like could save a few K with a rewrite,
	and there are just too many bugs when typeing in the middle (as opposed
	to at the end.)

Video Paint 267

FEATURES CHANGES:

o - Added a few spaces so one-key equivalents are right justified under
    'animator' menu.

BUG FIXES:

o - Color Paste is ungreyed after a Color Cut. (Fixes 22225)

o - Macro Playback of a loop segment hang seems to be gone.  (It was
    timing dependent and a little difficult to reproduce.  Would
	appreciate it if you could bang on it a little to make sure it's
	really gone.)  (22223)

o - Modulo is spelled correctly in add ink help.

INTERNAL CHANGES:

o - Made fli.h flihead structure consistent with quickfli.


Video Paint 266

FEATURES CHANGES:

o - Changed Swap to Back on home pull-downs.

o - Changed v.cfg configuration file to aa.cfg


Video Paint 265

FEATURES CHANGES:

o - You can no longer interrupt a flic load.  (Checking for interrupt was
    very slow with the tablet, and since you couldn't see it load a
	frame at a time not very useful in general.)

o - All the temp files renamed from vvtemp.xxx to aatemp.xxx.

o - In general Autodesk Animator substituted for Video Paint and
    Animator substituted for Vpaint throughout the program.

o - Vpaint button on quick menu change to home.

o - Alt screen changed to swap screen.

o - Took out 'unknown chunk type xxx' error message on browse menu.
    (Was for development really.  Later on I want to be able to
	put in new chunk types and just have them skipped....)

o - Changed 'Overlay past end?' to 'Composite past end?'

o - Changed "Composite video starting this frame?" to
    "Composite flic starting this frame?"
 
BUG FIXES:

o - Macro playback with Summa tablet much faster.

o - On spark ink help modulo is spelled correctly.


Video Paint 264

FEATURES CHANGES:

o - 'Sorry menus wouldn't be visible.'  error message put up after
    a 'menu colors' when not enough contrast between colors.
	(18990)

o - Menu colors is disabled when the last 5 colors are usurped by system.
	(It is confusing at best to try to set menu colors in this situation.)

o - Changed way I build the device list (which appears visibly as the
    drive buttons on the file requestor).  This should eliminate all
	the bogus middle buttons if you've got drive a: b: c: and z:.
	(Also moved device list scan 'til after I've installed my critical
	error handler so doesn't cause abort/retry/fail message to come up.)


BUG FIXES:

o - If in Zoom x4 and zoom box to far right or far down, no longer get
    screen wrap during expand x2.

Video Paint 263

FEATURES CHANGES:

o - Took out F2 'screen snapshot with menus' hotkey.

o   Cel position is updated after moving cel during stretch.
	(Is consistent with Size...) (Autodesk 22213)

o - 'Use overlay colors' changed to 'Use incoming colors' during
    a composite with different color maps. (22214)

o - Message when making a flic a certain # of frames long changed from
	"How many frames do you want in this video" to "How many frames
	do you want in this flic". (22216)

o - A 'clip mask' or 'show mask' will briefly flash menu white
    before going to the current color to give you a little more
	feedback when objects you're clipping are in current color. (22217)


BUG FIXES:

o - The first partition of your hard drive now appears in the temporary
	files selector even if you have no B: drive.  Fixed a side effect
	of eliminated the B: button. (22218)

o - 'Choice temporary drive' changed to 'Choose drive for temp. files:'
	(22219)

o - If run out of memory during a multi-frame paste or paste below,
	it stops after 1st frame.


Video Paint 262

FEATURES CHANGES:

o - 'e' is keyt equiv. for exit on files menu.

o - If you type in a drive as part of the file name, things work
    as you'd hope (the drive in the file name is used and the
	normal vpaint directory ignored.)   This way people can access
	things on drives that I don't have buttons for, or more quickly
	if they know the name and place of file.

o - All temp files are place in the directory VVT off the root of
    your temp device.  This makes it so you can have the temp device
	the same as you artwork device, and change directories without
	potentially. losing you cel/text/alt etc buffers.

BUG FIXES:

o - If no B: drive present, B: button shouldn't show up on file menu
    or browse menu.  (Please check this Terri and Cindy.  Should work,
	but I can't test it.)

o - If file name longer than 8 characters somehow, doesn't mess up browse
    menu.

o - After you delete a file in browse, the 'current file name' field goes
    blank. 
	(Fixes one of Terri's bugs.  Autodesk?????)


Video Paint 261

FEATURES CHANGES:

o - Put 'FF' 'PF' and 'CF' as visible key equivalents to flic/files, etc.


BUG FIXES:

o - Running out of drive space while recording a macro works even if
	macro write fails while over a 'yes/no' or 'continue' dialog.
	(Fixes Autodesk #18977)

Video Paint 260

FEATURES CHANGES:

o - 'b' toggles you between thin and thick brush.

o - changed optics/element/pic to flic.

BUG FIXES:

Video Paint 259

FEATURES CHANGES:

o - During operations applied to time segment, if there's insufficient
    room on ram disk you get error message:
		"Not enough space on scratch drive."
	(Before there was no message though program otherwise recovered ok.)

o - After a load flic Vpaint'll check for enough free space on scratch
    drive.

o - Embedded some 'type five sentinels' for Autodesk 'boxtop' serializer
    program.

BUG FIXES:

o - A bug doing overlays when _some_ of the frames have the same color
    map as the resident FLI and you do 'keep current colors' is fixed.

o - Doing a spline with 2-color on, open on, and filled on has outline
    matching with filled center.

o - 'No' response to 'overlay starting this frame' when doing a
    'use overlay colors' or 'combine color maps' doesn't screw up
	your palette.

o - Color Cycle over all when only have one frame works.

o - No memory error message is visible.


Video Paint 258

FEATURES CHANGES:

o - Clear track in optics has same effect on centers as clear all.

BUG FIXES:

o - Selecting any of the optics presets used to fragment memory.  No more.

o - Error messages on program startup (not mca/vga display, not enough
    memory) more readable.

o - PG DN won't take you past end of text buffer with bottom lines of
    text from previous page still visible.  This fixes Autodesk bug 
	#22209.

o - In text when you resize window to something wider, you don't end up 
	with window past end of text.

Video Paint 257

FEATURES CHANGES:

o - SYSTEM is used instead of GEM6X6 as the default font name.

BUG FIXES:

o - When can't find font, then name on font submenu reverts to system.
	(Fixes Autodesk bug 22208).

o - The following sequence in text editor doesn't cause a bad cookie crash:
		1. Go to text tool and define text box.
		2. Type in delete followed by return.

o - In Optics, movement drop-down selection asterisks are accurate even
    when you change them from Time Select (by right clicking over 'T'
	button on Optics and then say clicking on 'In Slow').

o - Resizing text box smaller than cursor size doesn't happen.  (If it's
    smaller Vpaint just increased the size of text box a bit.)  This used
	to hang up the computer.  (Fixes Autodesk bug #22206).

o - Polygon/spline elements in optics are no longer always closed.

o - Doing a spline element use/preview in optics doesn't turn your
    polytool into a splinetool.

o - 'M' on quick panel will turn off mask creation same as
    'use mask' on mask menu.

INTERNAL CHANGES:

o - Error message for summa tablet not installed taken out.  (It was never
    used.)



Video Paint 256

FEATURES CHANGES:

o - Arrow keys work like rest of program in frames menu.

o - Up arrow takes you to start of animation.

BUG FIXES:

o - Cel pastes in opaque with mask, or other non-transparent inks unbroken
    from bug in ink_blit(). 

o - Color 0 can be used as an endpoint of a ramp.  (Fixed bug in 
    define_ramp() routine where wasn't returning proper value.)


Video Paint 255

FEATURES CHANGES:

o - Left click over frame # which used to do nothing now takes you to
    time menu just like right click does.  (This was requested by people
	using the tablet where a left click is a lot easier than a right...)

o - Ranges on frames hilite when they match the current range.

o - Tile ink pays attention to key color.

BUG FIXES:

o - Spelled Bob Bennett's last name right in about box.

o - Using keyboard equivalents in mask menu doesn't leave trash under
    mask menu over your pretty picture.

o - Optics size ratio box works.  (Used to be permanantly 1.00)

o - In palette editor can move to next frame and have rgb/hls sliders
    update properly.

INTERNAL CHANGES:

o - Static/comment through cline.c.

FEATURES CHANGES:

BUG FIXES:

INTERNAL CHANGES:

o - Starting another pass through the source code.  Realize don't have time
    to 'heavily comment' all code.  Will selectively comment functions and
	try to make non-globals explicitly static.  Got through a's.

FEATURES CHANGES:

o - 'relaxed' rules for forcing last 5 colors to menu colors. 

o - Changed default menu colors to be just a bit darker.  (This also
    makes them less likely to take over your last 5 colors.)

BUG FIXES:

o - Drive buttons are back in file menus.  (I'd left off the closing
    part of a comment and inadvertently commented out a line in init.c...)

o - When moving text window and descenders hang off the bottom of window,
    no longer leave trails of pieces of text....

o - Single frame cel paste sets 'dirty frame' flag properly so changes don't
    get lost when you move to a new frame.

FEATURES CHANGES:

BUG FIXES:

o - Redid a couple of lines of zoom x4 assembler code that were a bug,
    but one that probably would never be noticed. 

INTERNAL CHANGES:

o - Light commenting on .c files through pentools.c

o - Heavy commenting on:
	fli.c
	marqi.c

o - Finished light commenting (through zoom.c!)

o - Took out unused line clipping code in clipit.asm

o - Light commenting on all assembler files.

o - Got rid of unused fli_has_colors flag.

FEATURES CHANGES:

o - Summa pad driver uses more of the pad in y dimension.


BUG FIXES:

o - In palette editor after setting up a cluster or forcing a ramp
    subsequent right click over color matrix to copy 1 color would
	at times leave a box supposed to hilite dest of color copy somewhere
	else - at times on the picture.  This bug is fixed.


INTERNAL CHANGES:

o - Light commenting on .c files through grid.c

o - Heavy comments:
		input.c 
		jfile.c

o - More light commenting through loadpix.c

BUG FIXES:

o - Effects menu stuff works over many frames.  (fixed rpmuzauto() )


Video Paint 249

BUG FIXES:

o - Clear pic and many other functions work again.  Tried to save 12
    bytes last time around and slipped a parameter.

o - Cursor doesnt stick to screen on a flip segment.  

INTERNAL CHANGES:  (Should not be noticable except unless I made a mistake)

o - Finished commenting a3d.c

o - Broke optical pull-downs into a separate file from a3d.c 
	Called it a3dpull.c - what an imagination I've got.


Video Paint 248

o - Fixed angle display hopping around with negative numbers in
    turn cel. (After backup)

o - Fixed single frame segment "play segment" hang.  (After backup)

Internal Changes (Not visible unless I screwed up...)

o - More commenting.  Heavy on:
		jimk.h
		config.c
		cpack.c
		csort.c
		cthread.c
		cursorda.c
		debug.c
		decoder.c
		diskerr.c
		dissolve.c
		dosstuff.c
	light: through comprs.c

o - Started commenting a3d.c (optics code except for the part about the
    menu...)  -  wow what a friggin huge file.

o - small optimizations on:
		csort.c
		config.c (just took out unused temp file name)

o - Changed video_form to vscreen for easier typing.

o - Sped up simple Cel pastes.

o - Did a small change that will make it more likely for temp file
    to survive intact on program crash or power failure (well if on
	hard disk on power failure).

o - Starting to comment the source code.  Put brief comment at the
    start of files through a3d.c to cel.c , and heavily commented:
		auto.c
		bfile.c

o - Did some misc refining/code squeezing on:
		auto.c 
		bfile.c
		cel.c

Video Paint 246		*******   1st Beta

o - Quit requestor warns you if you have unsaved changes.

o - Files menu has a mini time control set.

o - Changed 'splice' to 'join' in case I ever implement 'save segment'.

o - Changed about box a little.  Put in a line "GARY YOST" that
    you can do a binary edit on (lots of surrounding spaces) with
	name of person doing beta test to make people more paranoid about
	lending out their beta copy to our competitors.  (The 'big secret'
	GARY YOST is still in there for further confibulations and
	security concious freemishness....)
