VP BUGS
(X = fixed; last housekeeping 3/14,v238
(o = Jim thinks they're fixed 5/3/89 v257)
(y = Sorry, that's just the way it works.  If want change put it on features
     list.)
(z = Is a bug but don't think it's worth fixing considering....)
(? = Non-reproducable.  Will try to fix it when can figure out how 
	 to repeat it.



v256

-   On Terry Fritz's machine drive B: is shown on Browse and File requestor
    even though it doesn't exist.  Selecting it causes wild and buggy
	results.
	(Autodesk #18973 and #22207)

o   Resizing text editing box smaller than cursor size causes machine to
    hang.
	1. Choose Text and left click to set box.
	2. Add text (any amount).
	3. Left click outside of box so cross hairs appear to resize it
	4. Left click at 60 136 to set 1st point of new box.
	5. Move cursor to 63,138 and left click.  Screen dies.
	(Autodesk #22206)

o   When text is stored in memory and the font is then deleted, Reuse
    will return to the default text font onscreen but the font listed
	will remain the original font.  Thus the Drawing Tools box says "or use
	GEM Gonts below..." and the font listed is different than what is
	appearing onscreen.
	(Autodesk #22208)

-   When you PG DN and then END to get to the end of the text in the last 
	window, the cursor will stop before it has reached the last word.
	1) Choose text and create an editing box
	2) Fill the box up with text until it scrolls at least 2 windows.
	3) PG UP and you will go to the top of the 1st window.
	4) PG DN until you see the window containing the last line of scrolled 
	text.
	5) Cursor down to the last line of text in the last window
	6) END to go to the end of the line or right cursor to go to the end 
	of the  line and the cursor does not move to the end.  
	(Autodesk #22209)

o	Poly/spline elements in optics are always closed.  
	(ck)

y    Summa tablet record macro seems slow on playback, as if always
     real-time???   (Actually it's especially slow when pen is out of
	 proximity.   Could fix this by going to an interrupt driven
	 input driver for SummaSketch.)
	 (ck)

o    Movement Buttons in the Time Select panel not properly updating items in
     Movement menu of Optics Editor (when Time Select panel is entered from
     Optics Editor).

     1.   Enter Optics Editor.
     2.   Select Use.
     3.   Activate all movement buttons (Complete is already active).
     4.   Exit to Optics Editor.
     5.   Notice that the active items in the Movement menu do not have
          asterisks.
     6.   Select In Slow from Movement Menu.
     7.   Notice that all items except In Slow now have correct asterisks.

z    Stretched cel covers status line readout.  (This is deliberate.  
     I feel seeing cel is more important than seeing numbers.)
	(jp 256)

v255

o    Cookie: Make Text window. Press [Delete] then [Enter] -- crasho!
	 (jp 255)
o    Click on [M] button in control panel while Create is active does
     not turn off Create.  (Jim, I decided to add this as a bug after
     it screwed me up about four times one evening while I was doing
     some intensive mask stuff.  The first two times it happened, I
     wasn't sure what the problem was, and _I_ was the one who first
     discovered it.  Besides, it really isn't practical as a feature.)
	 (jp 255)
-    Optics: Clear All sets the center to the currently selected
     graphics element (cel, pic, etc.), but Clear Track sets it to the
     pic default no matter what the current element.  (If this is a
     feature, it seems backward.)
	 (jp 255)
o    Put Poly and Spline in the control panel.  Make a poly.  Select
     Spline in the Element menu of the Optics Editor.  Select Use, then
     Preview from the Time Select panel.  (Don't bother to render.)  Go
     back and use the Poly tool, which now uses the Spline settings. 
     (As does the Poly Tweening menu, Reuse, etc.)  Select Spline again
     to put Poly tool back to normal.
	 (jp 255)
z    Click on [+] button for a file named F99999.FLI to get a file
     named F-31072.FLI.
	 (jp 255)
o    Can't use color 0 as second endpoint of a color ramp.
	(jp 255)
o    Arrow keys don't work in frames menu.
	 (jk)
o    Go to mask menu.  Select 'clip' with the keyboard instead of mouse.
     Leaves a garbage box on your picture.
	 (ck)
-    Bang wildly on down arrow and 'n' keys while recording a macro.
     Macro will lose sync on playback sometimes.   (Actually this bug
	 has been around for last 50 versions or so.  Tried to fix it about
	 5 times so far and always just make it worse.)
	 (jk)
?    In zoom mode occassionally after a fill screen will flash horribly
     and machine lock up for about 1 minute.  Then all is well.  This
	 is a very erratic bug I haven't seen for about 3 weeks at all but
	 suspect it might still be around.  Never have been able to reproduce
	 it.

v253
o    Change RGB or HLS sliders on a color, then move to next
     frame without leaving palette editor: slider values remain
     the same although color slot in next palette is different.
?    Palette Value/Ramp: Does not accept key color as Stop color
     (tho does accept key color as Start color).
o    Crop effect works unpredictably with various inks.  Don't
     know if this is bug or feature, but I need to know what the
     process is here.  (E.g., gradient inks apply their pattern,
     glass seems to apply the key color in glass, emboss does its
     bit, but add doesn't seem to do anything, etc.)
-    On Lewis' AT, clicking on the F: drive button causes wild
     and erratic results.
o    Make a small text window with a large font.  Type some descenders
     (ie j's and g's).  Move around window.  Watch trail of descender pieces
	 muck up the screen (though gets cleaned up after finish moving window.)
o    Paste cel but do nothing else to frame.  Go to next frame.  Cel paste
     is lost!  (Showed up v250 or so.)
o    Set up a new cluster in palette editor (right click over active cluster).
     Now right click over matrix to copy a single color.  You'll see a
	 misplaced red color hilite box, and possible a grey one over the picture.
o    Make sure your time segment is a single frame.  Go 'loop segment'.
     Program hangs.



v246
o    Optics: Size Ratio number is not working.
o    Tile ink ignores [K]ey color clear setting.

v239
o    Frame range number box writes over Optics panel when F/S/A
     buttons are clicked from Optics panel.
o    Range buttons in Frames menu do not highlight (as Marks
     buttons do.)	

v236-238
-    Temp Drive alert gets lost if it can't access one of the
     drive in the range of active drives (like Eric's setup). 
     Also, does not show current temporary drive.
o    Inks lose their settings after a Tool change (e.g., select
     Box, adjust Dark ink to 20 with dither on.  Select Draw,
     then select Box, and Dark ink will be back to 50 with dither
     off.)
o    Menu lock-out: Select color Tint, right-click outside of MAX
     TINT PERCENT menu (or select Cancel) -- menu displays will
     not appear, though VP continues to function.  Press [Q] to
     quit, and reboot to normal.
o    Composite/Underlay opaque: Key color register is altered on
     Combine Colors and Use Overlay Colors.  Maintains key
     register on other two, but does a best fit on No Fit.
o    Optics: Spin/Center/Default doesn't work for poly and spline
     elements.
o    Color: Blend & Paste not greyed in Value menu.  (Get "Can't
     find vvtemp.ccl" message.)
y    Optics: Spin/Axis - the axis jerks around.  (Bug or
     feature?)
y    Unblue pastes key color.  (Shouldn't this work like Next
     Blue and restore image under blue?)	(No way it could work
	 like next blue.  Can be done over all...)
o    Paste Below ignores [K] button, always pastes opaque.
     (Noticeable with V Grad and other non-opaque inks.)
