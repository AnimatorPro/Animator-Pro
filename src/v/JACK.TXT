Subject: latest bugs & housekeeping
Status: R


Just uploaded an updated bugs list with housekeeping, up to v238.
(though didn't spend a lot of time searching for bugs in v238.  Just
checked previous ones.)  

Seems in pretty good shape.  I marked off some that I consider bugs,
but you consider features (grumble).  Left on a couple I suspect you
consider features, but I still consider bugs (hah).  Main bug now is
(I hope) not a feature.  New discrete Ink settings are lost after
tool switch (returns to ink defaults after moving away, then returning
to same tool).

Two semantic inconsistencies I've run into while going over the docs:
The word "close" crops up twice while using the "Near Colors" item
in the Cluster menu: The prompt at the top of the screen during
color selection, and in the threshold dialog after selecting the color.

Second has to do with 'curve' vs. 'spline,' and I think we may have
gone once around about this before.  I'd like to change the 'curve'
tool to the 'spline' tool to match its item in the Element menu
of the Optics screen.  (Since the other graphic elements, pic, cel, and poly
all match, and we can't put a 'curve' in the Elements menu.)

Anyway, I'm off to tackle the Optics section of the reference docs.  You 
can be sure I'll be back with more questions.
