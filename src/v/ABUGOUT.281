Jack found this bug ---- I will write it up formally and send it but I 
wanted to let you know right away.

Cross-fade with only 1 frame will crash to Dos

1) Save a flic with only 1 frame to disk
2) Load another flic and select cross-fade
3) Select the 1 frame file and answer o.k. to begin at this frame
4) CRASH.

sorry for the bad news but it is sure a good thing we got this now.  I 
checked underlay and overlay with only 1 frame and it is fine.

thanks.

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:  

 Adding frames by using the [*2] button, then deleting half of the
 frames, will cause garbage on the the screen during playback, which was left
 by the flic's image.
 
 - Load Fishf2.fli.  Enter the Frames control panel.
 - Drag the slider bar to the last frame in the Flic (50).
 - Press the [*2] button to double to number of frames.
 - Drag the slider bar back to frame #50.
 - Right-click on [Delete].
 - Enter 100 as the number of frames to delete.
 - Play the Flic.  Notice the garbage left on the screen
   by the flic's image.
 
 Note:  This happens also with MRNUMO.FLI and MRBLOB.FLI.
 It doesn't seem to happen with RRH.FLI (?) These were the
 only flics I checked.  Also, it's important that the steps
 are followed exactly to produce the bug.

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:  

 The stylus will remain active if you switch back and forth between the puck.
  The buttons are reversed because the puck buttons are being accomodated.  
 In order to maintain consistency, the stylus should be deactivated once 
 configured for the puck.
 
 1) Install for a stylus
 2) Go through configure and install for a puck 
 3) The stylus remains active with reverse buttons
 
 If this can't be at this late of date we will have to document the fact that
 the input device remains active when switching between the puck and the 
 stylus. Be sure the correct input device is installed before returning to 
 Autodesk Animator or the buttons will be reversed.

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:  

 If I load with the mouse installed, try to install for a summasketch tablet 
 and then decide to cancel to keep the  default configuration the following 
 occurs:
 
 - 0 to cancel takes you to a blank screen after about 50 seconds
 - C to cancel keeps the mouse deactivatecd and unless you install for the 
 summasketch driver you have to delete the aa.cfg.
 
 Cancel from the Puck or Stylus option should return you to the previous 
 default configuration.

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:  

 After using the [*2], [*3], or [*5] buttons to add frames

 be located close to, but not at the end of the flic.
 
 -Load MRNUMO.FLI.  Enter the Frames control panel.
 -Drag the slider bar to the last frame in the flic.
 -Press [*2] to double to number of frames in the flic.
 -Notice that when the frames panel reappears, you are
  at the second to the last frame in the flic, instead
  of the last.
 -This also happens if you use [*3] or [*5].
