o - Getting zoom closer to finished.  It's much faster now than it ever
    was.  Cursor now longer gets magnified though.  Also menus on odd
	boundary still lose a line.

Video Paint 99

o - Started to re-implemented zoom.  Not done by any means.  Broke
    down zoom blit into 'segments' so as to go around menus.  Not
	handling 'fractional parts' of segments yet.  (Ie when menus are
	not positioned over even increments of zoom factor).  With luck
	I've got straight which area of memory to draw on and update the
	screen from in zoom working properly.  (It's getting
	pretty gnarly.  Wish I could think how to do it simpler and not
	sacrifice another buffer. Aaarrrr!)



Video Paint 98

o - Circles work with 'solid' and '2 color'

o - F3 acts like a left mouse click, except it puts the coordinates in
    a buffer.  F4 will act like another left click at last place you
	'F3d'.  (Or center of screen if haven't pressed F3 yet.)

o - Improved jaggy positioning of petals and ovals (and short lines in
    general.)

o - Right click off menu now toggles menu.  (It seems pretty much like
    old vpaint except you can draw with menu up).  Hopefully this will
	bypass right button crash even if I still don't know what caused
	that erratic sucker.


Video Paint 97

o - May or may not have fixed Gary's right click crash bug.

o - Made 'filled' an attribute of the draw tool rather than having a
    separate draw tool for filled/outline.

o - Filled draw tools let you draw them with an outline in another color
    (the rightmost ink pot) when you select '2color'.

Video Paint 96

o - Fixed a color-menu pasted on your picture bug.

o - Jaggies between filled and outlined polygons match 100% at long last!

o - Macros work for ovals.



Video Paint 95

o - Fixed bogus blank line when menu at very top of screen and draw
    'under' menu.

o - Fixed a bunch of places where menu disappeared.

o - Space bar toggles menu on/off.

o - Macros are fixed (or better anyways) from some bugs the menu on 
    screen changed introduced.

Video Paint 94

o - Rubberbands don't eat menu.  Recoded circle draw and line draw routines
    into C (from assembler ... usually go other way) since they have to
	call C functions now and the C/ASM glue takes longer than I save
	with the coordinate calculator in ASM.  Jaggies on line a bit off.


Video Paint 93

o - In set range on palette the last line of the menu changes to show what
    color you're over and give you some prompts.

o - Color undo and restore work like undo and restore elsewhere.

o - The big one.  Menus stay up while you're drawing.  Right now it's
    a pretty rough implementation.  Zoom is temporarily disabled as a
	result.  'rubberband' moves over the menu cause it to get erased,
	though no permanent harm is done.  (Just move menu to redraw it.)
	Currently you can't get rid of the menus.  Probably will hang this on
	the space-bar.


Video Paint 92

o - Put in Gel tool.  It's sort of a Paint box like air-brush.  (Not
    quite as good but what the heck.)  It operates on top of the
	other ink-types.  Much faster in opaque though....  Should be
	able to specify a few parameters on this one in the future,
	but it's pretty fun now.  I especially like using it with reveal
	alt.  I used this technique a lot in 'carmened.gif' in my
	UNIX file space.

o - Repeat macro now lets you specify a count.

o - can load fonts now.  Right click over a font name.  The path for
    the fonts is saved in the configuration
	file, though it's updated automatically if you change it.
	(It's kept separate from the regular path.)

o - fixed bug where spread got outside color range when drawing
    spirals, or outlined polygons with a big brush.

o - Put in lots of numbers during lines and spirals.  Tested out
    yet another way to do spirals.  Reverted to old way for now.


----list of known bugs in video titler----
1. No undo in video titler.

2. Video titler frequently deposites 'marqi' outline of text onto
   screen and occasionally text as well.

3. Color map is not updated correctly when you leave a dirty frame in
   video titler.

4. Ugly eating-up of marqi outline when hit carraige return in titler.

----list of known bugs in video paint---
1. Jumble around edge seems to wrap.

2. Zoom box goes off screen when you're positioning it though it's clipped
   to the screen once the zoom starts.

3. Some things are invisible in zoom mode.  (What things?).

4. Color undo and restore are funky.  Inconsistent with rest of system.
   Most wierd when 'undoing' a pack (which can successfully be undone
   from the quick menu undo btw.).

----High priority wish list----
1. Way to insert new frames.
2. Way to overlay and matte fli's.
3. Text 'label' command.
4. Nice browsing 'library'.
5. Zoom x4 and x8 as well as current x2.
6. More keyboard equivalents that work.
7. Menus that stay up while you draw.
9. Stretchy/squashy operations.
10. A text editor that's less buggy and better organized.
11. Tilty/turny operations.




Video Paint 91

o - Radial spread.  You can set center...

o - Dither's an option with the spreads.

o - Added brushes up to size 10.


Video Paint 90

o - Variable brush sizes - right click over brush.

o - Spirals are different.  Takes three clicks.  First click is
    center.  Next is direction of initial arm from center.  Now
	swish the cursor around center and click when you're happy with
	the result.


Video Paint 89

o - Made drawing with brush faster again.  (Doing a little filled polygon for
    fat lines.  Looks really funky in translucent mode all right!)

Video Paint 88

o - Added Pixelate to auto.

o - Auto choices let you do things to a single frame.

o - Made place text, separate, and flood all go through render_pixel()
    to make clipping easier when do menu on-screen.

o - Made draw brush and so forth go through render_pixel().  This slows
   drawing with a big brush in opaque considerably.  The way I'm drawing
   fat lines by 'dragging' a brush is pretty idiotic actually.  Should
   fix it at a higher level.  Maybe it's slow enough now I will.  (Look
   on the bright side.)

Video Paint 87

o - Changed (and improved) the way a lot of ink types work around the
    edge of the screen.

o - Made petals stick to cursor at the end of the leaf and the number
    of petals follows the 'points' slider.

o - Implemented Ovals.

Video Paint's now about 1K larger than Cyber Paint 2.0.  Time for some
time functions perhaps?

Video Paint 86

o - Got an emboss ink type.  Think it needs more work though.

o - Got smear and pull ink types.  Variations on a theme.  Both tend to
    move pixels in the direction of mouse motion.  Smear is more intense.

o - Gave up doing gif save in assembler.  Works again in C.

o - Zoom cursor ain't screwy and fast.  (Bug introduced with grid...)

o - Can set text in opaque mode.


Video Paint 85

o - Tried to do gif save in assembler.  No go yet.

o - 16 color and 32 color reductions ask if it's for the ST and Amiga
    respectively.  If so they round the color palette to adjust for
	ST having 8 shades of grey, Amiga 16.


Video Paint 84

o - Added coordinates to 'rub out a box' routine.  Use in make grid and
    grab cel and boxes and frames.

o - Improved (or sped up at least) Petals a bit.

o - Improved color reductions to very few colors especially and color reductions
	in general (but not true-color file loads yet) by sorting palette according
	to use before doing my 'threshold-streaming' algorithm.

o - [F2] will take a screen snapshot to vsnapsho.gif. (Including menus...)

0 - Added spirals.


Video Paint 83

o - Fixed Macros (Broke with Snap to).

o - Ink Strength only appears when relevant;

o - Added Petl (Petal) draw option.

o - Stars and Petls let you set # of points and 'inner radius'.

o - RPoly lets you set # of points.

o - Spray lets you set speed and spread.


Video Paint 82

o - Added Snap to Grid.  This is on same menu as mask stuff.  Not a good
    place really.  Guess Gary and Jack will figure out how to organize
	all these features....


Video Paint 81

o - Check out the mask stuff.  (Rightmost drop-down).


Video Paint 80

o - Yous got shapes stars and regular polygons (all either filled or
    outlined) in yer options menu.

o - Made it so jaggies of filled and outline polygons match (well
    99% of the time or so...)

o - Macros involving polygons are faster.


Video Paint 79

o - Added filled and outlined polygons to draw tools.


Video Paint 78

o - Added 'pack' to palette.  Check it out.

o - Re-worked loading of true-color frames a bit as this is so related to pack.


Video Paint 77

o - Bug saving GIF after just loaded an interleaved GIF nuked.

o - Added Darken ink type.

o - Crash and wierdness loading interleaved pics of 350 lines gone.

o - Larger than 320x200 GIF's now are color-average shrunk.  It's still
    and 'integer' shrink.  Sometimes the aspect ratio gets off as a
	result and it doesn't fill the whole screen.

o - Copy color and color range select functions in palette hilight
    when clicked.  (A little feedback, still need some more I think.)


Video Paint 76

o - Fixed a bug in 'ink type' menu.  Got screwy when you clicked on
    the white part of the menu border.  (Think this may have been root
	of 'rainy white streaks' bug.

o - GIF saves almost 2x as fast.


Video Paint 75

o - GIF is now default picture suffix.  (You can still load/save .pic's
    by making sure file has .PIC extender).

o - larger than 320x200 GIF's load in middle.

o - Implemented my own buffered file io and using it for macros.  (Shouldn't
    notice anything except perhaps slight speed improvement unless I put
	in some bugs by mistake.)   I'm using this for GIF's too.

o - 'interleaved' GIF's load properly.


Video Paint 74

o - Fixed transparent paste out of memory bug.

o - Loads upper left corner of larger GIFs.

o - First pass at Video Editor display.  (Wants vpaint.fli and manga.fli
    in current directory).  Top strip (which is your current animation)
	has active color map.  Rest will probably look odd indeed.

o - .PIC files are saved byte-run-length compressed.

o - Alt Screen and Cel temp files are deleted after loading when program
    starts up to conserve ram-disk space.

Video Paint 73

o - 320x200 GIF's load.

o - Fixed a bug where ink type and draw tools help selection drawn on
    screen not menu in zoom mode.

o - Fixed 'horizontal white bars' in speed menu bug.

o - Text cursor is now same color as text (over clear background) and basically
    looks like inverse video over the characters.

o - Save text cursor position in temp.flx.

o - Save scroller offsets for filemenu ink-type and draw-tool in temp.flx.
    As far as I know all context is saved.


Video Paint 72

Think I finally got the text editor nailed.  May be a few bugs, but 
finally found an elegant and effective way of coping with the word wrap
during insert, deletes, and backspaces.  Yea!


Video Paint 71

Mostly more text editor work.  Think I'm going to let it rest a while
and go work on the video editor.  Looks pretty good except when typing in
the middle of the line the word-wrap will get a little ugly.  It
reformats when you hit the right button.  Other changes of note:

o - You can 'place' text that's not at the top of the file.

o - You still have no undo in the text editor.  Watch those 'places'.
	(Restore should still work though.)

o - Program no longer crashes when you hit backspace.

o - Fonts are always loaded from your start-up directory.

o - Font context saved with the rest in temp.flx

o - Traded NEWYRK09 for the huge (and kinda ugly I think) GALLIA48.

o - You can type a word too big to fit in one line and program copes with
    it.  (I wonder what will happen if you make your window too small for
	one letter though.  Hehe.)


Video Paint 70

Text editor debugging.  Hasn't crashed in a while, but it's still got
some more work.    Next text editor I write will probably be easier,
but I think wordwrap with proportionally spaced fonts is just generally
hairy.

Video Paint 69

o - Added 'close holes' ink type.  Also sweep.

o - Made 'add' and 'shatter' inks look at ink strength.

Video Paint 68

o - Did up Draw Mode menu with scroll bar so can keep adding more
    of them.

o - Renamed Draw Mode menu to Ink Type menu.

o - Added desaturate, brighten, and outline Ink Types.

o - Made Cel/Paste work after a fashion with all ink types.

o - Changed Tint Percent to Ink Strength.  Slider now effects Jumble,
	Saturate and Brighten as well.


Video Paint 67


o - Save Path and Filename in the temp file.

o - Changed 'restore default settings?' to 'keep current settings' on
    File/New so could do a yes/yes response (easier) and keep settings.
	(Most of time you want to keep settings...)

o - Fixed transparent paste.

o - Can clear text.

o - Got rid of a few debugging messages in text editor.

o - Made color squares on palette menu bigger.

o - Color cut and paste work.

o - Color undo works better.

o - No longer save sail.fnt on startup.  Mostly I just wanted a magnetic
    copy of this.  Got more than a few now.


Video Paint 66

o - Continued debugging of editor.

o - Editor keeps user changes now.  Vaguely usable if still not perfect.

o - Fixed macro bug.  It was a new one and quite idiotic.  Had a
    '<' sign where I needed a '>' sign.

o - Changed compression memory allocation so that takes 65K less to save
    a frame that's been changed.  Also will go 'out of memory' a lot
	less often than it used to even when it does run out.  Still have
	to decide what to do when do run out compressing a frame.  In
	Cyber Paint you ended up losing your latest changes, but did advance
	to the next frame (if that's when you provoked it to flush).
	On this one I think it will not 'go to next frame' but instead stay
	where you are and tell you to get out of zoom, free your alt screen,
	and free your Cel.  (Need to put in a free cel too...).  Of course if
	you've done all that and still out of memory not much you can do,
	but this shouldn't happen if I check for a threshold amount of memory
	on startup (unless I forget to free something somewhere.).


Video Paint 65

o - Still more work on text editor.  Almost ready to keep changes abuser
    makes.  Can select cursor position with mouse, delete and backspace
	fairly reliably, and insert except when cursor is one past a carraige
	returnt.  Proportional word wrap is mostly working.  Need to propogate 
	wrap past immediately following line though.


Video Paint 64

o - Further work on text editor.  Starting to be able to insert and
    delete text.  Cursor keys, page up and down, home and end all work.


Video Paint 63

o - Just starting on the text editor.  Got it so can move cursor around
    with arrow keys (adjusting for proportionally spaced font) but that's
	about it.  Some doubly linked list primitives.

I've noticed a sporadic hang when doing repeat macro.  Wonder if this
is same old bug or a new one.


Video Paint 62

o - Reorganized pull-downs a bit.  The dread menu menu is back!  Takes
    you to one of 3 places: the paint program, the titling program, or
	the editing program (or back to dos).  Currently the titling and
	paint ones are the only ones of interest.  

o - Started titler.  You can't type in text yet, but you can load it
    from a file.  It's very rough right now.  Hit 'tex/load' to load up
	a file.  'tex/place' to 'render' the text onto current frame.
	When you click away the menus you're back in the paint program.
	Someday soon you'll be in a mini text editor instead.

The program will create a 'sail.fnt' file on startup.  Would suggest
you copy bway24.fnt, koloss48.fnt, and gallia48.fnt to your working
directory too.  Rough as it is you can already see some of the advantages
of object oriented text.



Video Paint 61

o - expanded Options menu (right click over 1 of 6 drawing funct...)
	Still haven't implemented the right hand side which will contain
	little ways to customize the option (airbrush speed and size, font
	etc.).  But got the 'help' box working with word-wrapped text.
	Whoopie!

Video Paint 60

o - Added 'autoincrement file name' via the '+' icon on the file
    requestor.

o - Added another line at bottom of palette.  Cut and Paste don't work
    on it yet.

o - Still having trouble with Macros.  fopen bandaid didn't work.  Converted
    macro stuff to unbuffered io like the rest of the program.  Still
	will probably want an 'fprintf' to work someday.

o - Alt frame and Cel get saved so they're there when you reload the program.

o - Load and Save Cel implemented.


Video Paint 59

o - Ported it all to Turbo C and eventually made it work.  There's a
    little problem in that the Turbo C fopen() routine doesnt work
	after my custom memory manager gets in place.  Currently this is
	only used by the macro functions.  I put a band-aid on this by
	fopening 3 files before the memory initialization takes place.
	(Apparently once 3 files are opened once, they can be opened again
	later without Turbo C doing more memory stuff...)  Hopefully when
	I get Turbo C 2.0 I can use their mlalloc() for memory and avoid
	sneaking around like this.

o - Added 'greys only' to 'auto' drop-down so Eric's pyramid could
    be remapped easily to one color space.  The Compaq is fast enough
	we don't get flashing even with the original, but this also
	makes for 25% or so better compression.

Video Paint 58

o - Implemented Draw Mode menu (get it by right click over draw mode box
    in lower left of quick menu.)

o - Left click on draw mode box toggles between last exotic mode and 
    'opaque'.

o- Implemented 'Alt Screen' functions for scratch drawing area/alt
   drawing source.


Video Paint 57

o - More work on color palette.  Most is pretty self-explanitory.  Right
    click on color range lets you set range.  Next two clicks define
	start and end of range.  (They may be on menu or on picture.)

Video Paint 56

o - Started work on color palette.

o - Implemented "hang_child" routine so can re-use inkwells and mini-
    time menu ( | < 4 > >> ^ ) menus and routines so not to duplicate
	data structures and code like in Cyber Paint.

o - Squashed bug most apparent when moving file requestor, but present
    when moving most any menu.

o - Converted font and cursors to bytes so intel_swap during initialization
    unnecessary.  (Had to do it sooner or later I guess.)


Video Paint 55

o - Debugging zoom.  Saving zoom context with all the rest in temp.flx.

o - You keep your old color map when hit new unless you 'restore initial
    settings'.

o - Big brushes work in draw mode 1.


Video Paint 54

o - Started on zoom.  Seems to work mostly too.

Video Paint 53

o - Reworked restore handling to eliminate 'rf' buffer saving 64K, yea!


Video Paint 52

o - Fixed bug (introduced when switched to Microsoft) in draw/line/drizzle/
    circle in drawing modes that weren't plain vanilla.

o - Improved disk routine to not write same horizontal line more than
    once in anticipation of using disk for brushes....


Video Paint 51

o - Improved PIX and TGA true-color conversion again.  Think it's 
    definitely better than median cut now.

o - Uses less dynamic memory for menus.

o - >64K frames don't crash

o - Sped up a going back a frame and going to last frame a bit (by not
   changing color palette until arrive at destination frame, and in
   the case of go to last frame making intermediate frames invisible.)

o - Colors are correct when restart V with something already in the 
    temp file.



Video Paint 50

o - converted to MicroSoft C.  Code leapt from 90650 bytes to 115036.
    (Double aarrgg.)


Video Paint 49

o - File selector '..' button working.

o - A few less bugs in the file selector

o - Color map bugs re-arranged.  Most fixed.

Video Paint 48

o - It's all in large model now.  Code leapt from 78748 to 90650 bytes.
    Arrg.

Video Paint 47

o - V looks for new black white and red colors to draw menus in if
    current ones aren't suitable.

Video Paint 46

o - Loads 32 bit .TGA images

o - File requestor has a working '\' (go to root dir) option.

o - Flood changed to FillTo.

This one is the last one fitting in the small code model.  Pity.
Next rev probably will be nothing more than putting in far's in
place of near's in all my subroutines. 


Video Paint 45

o - Color reduction algorithm near perfect.


Video Paint 44

o - This one loads some types of still frame files:  .VGA from
    Everex convert program, .PIX from ColorScheme16 on Everex, and
	.PIC, which is V's own format (fast).   Will only save out .PIC.

Working on color reduction algorithm (from 32K to 256).  Still got a
ways to go.

Notes on Video Paint 43

o - First frame now saved byte compressed one line at a time.  This is
    now very close to the final FLI format.  See the FLI.DOC file for
	more info on FLI's.  Please convert your old FLI files to new format
	by hitting undo on the first frame, and then saving them back out
	again.  (You can do a lot of the work with a macro ... yea!)

o - A bug which would make it hang after playing for a while (when the
    clock wrapped around 16 bits aarrgghh) is fixed.

In other news I've decided to do a separate editor program.  Much of
the stuff in Cyber Paint which was done in 'to all' mode will be done
in this program.  I (and everyone else) really hated those 'to frame'
'to segment' 'to all' modes in Cyber Paint/Zoetrope.  Though they may
be a necessary evil, I anticipate that most of the time you'll either
be doing things 1 frame at a time or with a macro in the Paint part.  And
doing things that transform full frames and series of frames in the Editor
part.

Pragmatically I'm about to hit the 64K code barrier on this machine where
I have to go change the basepage offsets of all my parameters passed
to assembler.  Don't feel like dealing with this right now, but still want to
do the '3 strips of 4 frames' displays for the browse/edit functions
right away. They'd put vpaint over the edge.   It'd be possible to
reintegrate the two programs, but would like to experiment with this
separation from a design standpoint anyways.  I think if there's a menu
option to go from one program to another, since they both save context,
the user will have no complaint, might not even be aware that there are
two .EXE's involved.

Fixed slow clock.

Can adjust speed of playback by right clicking over replay double arrow.

Changed things so works with Eric's trackball.

Added 'clock disabling' to configuration menu.

Notes on Video Paint 40 

This one has changed a fair bit inside, but not much on the outside.
Most noticeably the program starts up with the menus up rather than
with the drawing screen.  I like this better.  Something a little intimidating 
about a black screen.

Mostly I've been refining the macro handling.  There's still a ways to go.
I'm trying to separate the control information (ie what menu selection
was picked) from the drawing/cursor button state info in the macro stream.
This should make the macro files much shorter, and allow us to add spatial
offsets to the macros.

Hmm, speaking of macros, they are files now, and can be loaded and saved.
Also no longer use a 40K ram buffer, instead doing yet another temp file.
Also while I'm trying to make macros more 'abstract', the utility of 
extremely 'literal' macros is pretty apparent, especially for tutorials
and demos.  Hence the selection 'start realtime' on the macro menu.  This
will create a macro that will be played back at precisely the same speed
you created it.

Other changes include:
	1. The options menu is alphabetized.
	2. Your default 6 drawing options changed around a bit.
	3. Flood has been changed to fill.  Flood is now a fill to an edge color.
	   (Select flood.  Then click on the color you want to fill out to.
	   Then click on the inside of the shape.

That's all I can remember.  See you later,
	-Jim
