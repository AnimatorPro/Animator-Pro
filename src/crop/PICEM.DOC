adjust the brightness and contrast in your pictures and save them back out.

 PICEM is not shareware, it is freeware, meaning that you can copy and
distribute PICEM on a non-profit basis (you cannot sell it).


 .PIC	images are PC Paint and PICTOR images. PC Paint is published by MSC
	tech, (previously named "Mouse Systems"). PICTOR is the Paint program
	which is part of the GRASP package published by Paul Mace Software.

 .PCX	images are PC Paintbrush format images. PC Paintbrush is published
	by Z-Soft.

 .GIF	images are Graphics Interchange Format, a generalized picture format
	supported by Compuserve,  The PICS Forum on Compuserve is one of the
	best places to obtain an assortment of image files including some
	stunning hiresolution 256 color images (ideal for VGA and SuperVGA 
	cards).


 For any bug reports I can be contacted on CIS (Compuserve) ID:73307,606 in
the PICS Forum, To enter the PICS forum on Compuserve just type "GO PICS"

PICEM  - Picture view utility
         Version 1.9b - November 22, 1988
         Written by John Bridges,  Copyright(C) 1987,1988

To use this utility, execute the following command:

PICEM {/d:x,y /k /l /w:t /v:vmode{,xsize,ysize,vnum}} fname ...

The parameters are as follows:

/d:x,y      - set lower left hand coordinates to display picture

/k          - do not wait for a keypress between pictures

/l          - display pictures in continous loop

/w:t        - Wait t 1/100ths of a second after each picture

/v:vnum
      vnum  - BIOS video mode number to set (vmode defaults to 'L')
              this is the short order version of the full /v: option
              it is intended for SuperVGA modes.

/v:vmode{,xsize,ysize,vnum}
      vmode - video mode most similar to the mode you are choosing:

   0 = 40x25 16 color text              2 = 80x25 B&W text
   1 = 80x25 16 color text              3 = EGA 80x43, VGA 80x50 16 color text

   A = CGA 4 color                      L = VGA/MCGA 320x200 256 color
   B = PCjr/Tandy 16 color              M = VGA 640x480 16 color
   C = CGA 640x200 2 color              N = Hercules InColor 720x348 16 color
   D = EGA 640x200 16 color             O = VGA/MCGA 640x480 2 color
   E = EGA 640x350 2 color              P = EGA/VGA 800x600 2 color
   F = EGA 640x350 4 color              Q = EGA/VGA 800x600 16 color
   G = EGA 640x350 16 color             R = S-VGA 640x400 256 color
   H = Hercules 720x348 2 color         S = S-VGA 640x480 256 color
   I = Plantronics 16 color             T = S-VGA 800x600 256 color
   J = EGA 320x200 16 color             U = S-VGA 1024x768 2 color
   K = AT&T/Toshiba 640x400 2 color     V = S-VGA 1024x768 16 color
                                        W = VGA 360x480 256 color

      xsize - optional width of the video mode you have chosen in pixels
      ysize - optional height of the video mode you have chosen in pixels
      vnum  - the BIOS video mode number for the mode you have chosen

fname       - the name of the first picture to view, formats supported are:
              .GIF (Compuserve Graphics Interchange Format)
              .PIC (PC Paint, PC Paint Plus, PICTOR, GRASP)
              .PCX (PC Paintbrush, Publishers PC Paintbrush)


 PICEM accepts wildcard filenames, so you could:

	PICEM \PICS\*.GIF
or

	PICEM /V:M,800,600,0x29 \CIS\*.GIF

or
	PICEM /K /D:20,30 /V:L FRAME??.PIC

or
	PICEM /V:0x66 TIME?.GIF


 Examples for most of the SuperVGA type cards:

ORCHID/GENOA		640x350x256		PICEM /V:0x2d
ORCHID/GENOA		640x480x256		PICEM /V:0x2e
GENOA			720x512x256		PICEM /V:0x2f
ORCHID/GENOA		800x600x256		PICEM /V:0x30
ORCHID/GENOA		1024x768x16		PICEM /V:M,1024,768,0x37
AST/PARADISE		640x400x256		PICEM /V:0x5e
AST/PARADISE		640x480x256		PICEM /V:0x5f
VIDEO 7			640x400x256		PICEM /V:0x66
VIDEO 7			640x480x256		PICEM /V:0x67
VIDEO 7			720x540x256		PICEM /V:0x68
VIDEO 7			800x600x256		PICEM /V:0x69
VIDEO 7			1024x768x16		PICEM /V:M,1024,768,0x65


 Some cards may require the long hand video mode description, for example:

			PICEM /V:0x2e WETT WETT2 ZOE2
could be written as	PICEM /V:L,640,480,0x2e WETT WETT2 ZOE2
