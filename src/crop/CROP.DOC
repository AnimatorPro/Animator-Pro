crop 41
	o - Updated copyright and put in IBM DOS 5.0 fix to leave DOS 8K instead
	    of 4K.

crop40
	o - Updated copyright notice

crop39
	o - Added support for 256 color .PCX files.

crop38
	o - Separated English language strings from .c files into .str files.

crop37

	o - Changed an indirect function call to a conditional branch in
	    pcx.c so as to get it to link with the 'RELOAD' option.
		(It isn't using the RELOAD now, but might some day.)

crop36
	o - Can now have more than 800 items in file selector.

	o - Rearranged overlay structure a bit to get back memory PCX
	    file handling used up....

crop35
	o - Changed the way single bit-plane PCX files are handled so
	    as to use less memory.  (A lot of people were running out
		of memory scaling down scanned in images.)

crop34
	o - Changed name to convert.exe to fix bug with plink overlay
	    manager finding executable under MS-DOS 2.1 and 2.0

	o - Error messages early during initialization should be more
	    visible (not just flash briefly.)

crop33
	o - Checks for no mouse driver under MS-DOS 2.1 without crashing.
	   (NULL check on interrupt 51)

crop32
	o - Internal changes to compile under Watcom C

	o - If you have a directory like 12345678.DIR, the last letter
	    doesn't hang off the file requestor.

crop31
	Not a version.  (Aborted)

crop30
	0 - When pictures are color reduced, they are taken to 251 colors
	    instead of 255, so there is room for menu colors.

crop29
	o - If can't find a file to load you get an error message and
	    the screen is cleared.

crop28
	o - C and up key equiv's for drive buttons work on file requestor
	    even if you have no b drive.

	o - B: in file name on machine without B: is ok.

	o - The date changed on status box to be in sync with Animator

crop27
	o - Key equivalents to drive buttons in file selector work better
	    if you have a missing B: drive.

	o - The date changed on status box to be in sync with Animator

crop26
	o - Summa input handling slightly changed to go with puck
	    option in Animator.

	o - The date changed on status box to be in sync with Animator

crop25
	o - Will load ANIM files of less than 5 bitplanes without screen
	    garbage.

	o - Changed the about box to go with Autodesk Animator.

crop24
	o - Swapped two line in init.c that will hopefully have the effect
	    of eliminating abort/retry/cancel error messages on susceptible
		machines during program startup.

	o - Made visible version info in about box go with Autodesk Ani's latest.

crop23
	o - Finished implementing (320x200) ANIM reads.


	o - If you type in say Z: as your directory and don't have any Z: drive,
	    the button hiliting should be correct after vpaint figures out
		there's no such drive.


crop22
	o - Added apostrophe to cant in 'cant find the mouse' error
	    message.

	o - Put in stubs and user interface for Amiga ANIM files reads.

crop21
	o - 'Scaling blue compenentt' has one less t.  (Actually fix
	    was 1 more space after component.)

	o - Viewing a gif file doesn't come with lots of palette snow.

	o - Installed new get_devices() routine from vpaint.  This one
	    works when you've got a: and c: but no b:.

	o - Changed name from crop to converter.

	o - Changed a few Vpaint and Video Paint's to Autodesk Animator.

	o - Made it look for configuration in aa.cfg instead of v.cfg.

	o - Put a date in the about box.

crop20
	o - Input is decidely less broke.  (Really blew it on crop19!)
		You can even use the keyboard!

	o - Computer doesn't hang when you try to load a file as a RIFF
		that ain't a RIFF.

crop19
	o - Made no mouse error message more visible.

	o - Support Summa tablet.  (You need to have a v.cfg file from
		vpaint that's been set up for Summa in the crop startup directory.)

crop 18
	o - Key hit when program starts up doesn't cause 'flicker menu bar'
	    hang up

	o - Down arrow plays sequence.  Right arrow goes to next frame.
	    Up arrow goes to start.  (Left arrow doesn't do anything...)

	o - When causing a dimension to expand, and the original
		length times the expanded length is greater than 32k,
		no more wierdness and crash.

crop 17
	o - dx,dy coordinates in move/slide with mouse are correct.

	o - Put a one line comment at start of every source file.

	o - Cut out some assembler line clipping code that was never
	    used in clipit.asm

crop 16
	o - Took out 'about to scale rbg files' debug message when
	    scaling a targa pic.

	o - You can scale mac pics.

	o - Using code overlays in crop.  (Mostly just for practise.)

	o - Put in 'memory' menu item.  (So I can tell if overlays are doing
	    any good...) (Actually they save about 15K)

crop 15
	o - Reads (at least most) PCX files.

	o - Put in a special case for Targa scaling.  When it's unsized
	    (ie after a revert) takes up less memory.  Works on my machine
		even with CEMM.

crop 14
	o - Dithering option in scale.

	o - Worked on some auto-extending in file menu.  It's not quite like
	    Vpaint.  Basically GIF and FLI saves auto extend.  The various
		loads do not.  (The rational is that the auto-extend on save
		keeps you from overwriting your source file most of the time.
		On the other hand there really aren't standard suffixes for
		many of the amiga, mac, etc picture types.  Also on a load you
		probably selected name from the scroller, so autoextend not
		necessary.)

	o - Display coordinates during move.

crop 13
	o - Move keeps going until you right click.  

	o - Scale menu is in.

	o - Targa files load originally in black and white.  You must
	    scale them to get color.  (This is just cause it takes 
		soooo long to convert them to 256 color files.  You can
		make sure you got the right file, and dont have to wait
		twice if it's a wierd scaling factor you want.)

crop 12
	o - Reads IFF pics (Amiga and Dpaint).  Brushes too for that matter.

crop 11
	o - Reads ST format pictures - .NEO, .PI1, .PC1, .PI2, .PC2, .PI3, 
	    .PC3.

crop 10
	o - Can load MacPaint pics and scroll them.  Macpaint pics are big enough
	    I don't have the memory to scale them the same way I do GIF's.
		Also they are black and white so could potentially use much
		faster algorithms.  Anyways for now the 'scale' selection
		just gets greyed out.

crop 9
	o - TARGA scaling pretty well done. 

crop 8
	o - TARGA color loads.

crop 7
	o - You can load in TARGA or VISION files in black and white.
	    (compressed or uncompressed.)

crop6 
	o - You can now scale any GIF to 320x200.

crop5
	o - starting to work on pixel-averaging scaling.  It's about 1/2 way
	    there.  It does the scaling down in true color space and leaves
		the result in 3 files (red green and blue) ok.  Haven't gotten
		to where it finds the best color map for the scaled result yet.
		Intermediate results displayed on screen some.  Looks like
		the interpolation routine is working pretty well.  Sure is 
		slow though!

crop4
	o - Loads and saves GIF's.  Always saves 320x200 image currently on
	    screen.  Loads any size. 

	o - You can move (or have the computer slide) around the portion of
	    a gif visible on screen.  The GIF will wrap around (soonish if
		it's small).

crop3
	o - It works with .SEQ files.

crop2
	o - Got crop saving FLI's.  

crop1 
	o - Got it playing RIF's and FLI's, the pulldowns and file requestor
		hacked out of Vpaint.
