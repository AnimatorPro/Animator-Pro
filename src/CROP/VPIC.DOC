Hi -
	here are some relevant sources for GIF files.  Hopefully you'll be able
to figure out what you need from these.  The file jimk.h is huge and mostly
concerned with the inner details of vpaint.  Try not to read more of it
than you have to.

	For a simpler alternative you might try a .PIC file.  To create one
save a pic from Vpaint typing in a .PIC suffix in place of the default
.GIF one for the file name.  You'll then get a 64800 byte file with the
following structure:

#define PIC_MAGIC 0x9119
struct pic_header
	{
	UWORD type;
	WORD w,h,x,y;
	char d;
	char compress;
	long csize;
	char reserved[16];
	};

as a 32 byte header.  Read it in and make sure the type field is PIC_MAGIC.

Next you have the color map.  This is 256 entries of 3 bytes each.  They
are RGB components with each component ranging from 0 to 63.

Finally there's 64000 bytes of pixel data.  It's a byte a pixel.  It starts
in the upper left corner and goes from left to right top to bottom.
