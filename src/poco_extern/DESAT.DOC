INTRODUCTION & INSTALLATION 

    DESAT.POC is an Animator Professional POCO program that can adjust the 
luminance and/or color saturation level of an entire flic. The program was 
written to fill a need in converting a large number of presentation flics 
to video. The specific problem that we encountered was that what looks 
"good" on a computer screen often looks "terrible" when the flic is 
converted over to a video tape. This happens because we, like most 
others, tend to use very highly saturated colors at high intensity levels. 
DESAT.POC works by changing every frame's palette, the RGB values of every 
color register in the palette, to a new luminance and/or saturation level 
while maintaining the same color Hue. 
 
    The DESAT.ZIP file contains 2 files. These files should be copied/moved 
to the indicated directories, and are: 

       DESAT.DOC - This file, containing the documentation. This file is 
                   not needed for program operation. 
       DESAT.POC - The ASCII text file containing the program. This file 
                   should be placed in the Animator Pro resource directory 
                   (typically this would be \ANI\RESOURCE) if you want the 
                   program to be instantly available from the Animator Poco 
                   menu. If you just want to access the program by using 
                   the "Use" item from the Poco menu, it can be placed in 
                   any directory. 
 
OPERATION

    Program operation is started from the Animator Professional POCO menu. 
See the Animator Professional documentation for complete instructions 
regarding the operation of this menu. 

    When first invoked, the program displays a typical Animator Pro menu as 
its Main Menu, titled "Change Intensity & Saturation". This menu has the 
various program options that can be selected. These options are: 

    Luminance adjust - This option allows setting the percent change to the 
          flic's intensity level, or the Luminance component of the HLS 
          values. When selected, a slider-bar window appears for entry of 
          the percent change in luminance or intensity. After this value 
          has been entered, control is returned to the Main Menu. If the 
          value entered was non-zero, the Luminance Adjust menu item will 
          now be preceded with an asterisk (*) to let you know that the 
          item is active. 

    Saturation adjust - This option allows setting the percent change to 
          the flic's color Saturation level, the S component of the HLS 
          values. When selected, a slider-bar window appears for entry of 
          the percent change in saturation level. After this value is 
          entered, control is returned to the Main Menu. If the value 
          entered was non-zero, the Saturation Adjust menu item will now be 
          preceded with an asterisk (*) to let you know that the item is 
          active. 

    Set Adjustment type - This option allows changing the technique used to 
          apply the Luminance adjustment. This is discussed in greater 
          detail later. The default setting for this parameter is normally 
          the best one to use for converting flics to video. 

    About Program Info. - Selecting this option displays a program 
          information box containing the version of the program and 
          information about the author. When the continue button on the 
          program information box is selected, the program returns to this 
          Main Menu. 

    Execute changes - This option is selected to apply the changes that you 
          have selected to the current flic. Because this is a major, non-
          recoverable change to the current flic, and overwrites the 
          current Swap buffer, a message box is presented after the menu 
          option is selected to give you another chance to cancel. Once you 
          click the Yes button on the message box, the flic is changed, and 
          you are returned to the normal Animator Pro screen. WARNING: 
          Executing the change completely modifies all color palettes used 
          in the flic. Due to the potential for round-off errors, 
          restoration of the original palette(s) with this program is 
          considered to be a practical impossibility. SAVE YOUR WORK before 
          proceeding. 

    Cancel - Select this option to cancel the DESAT.POC program without 
          making any changes to the current flic. 

LUMINANCE ALGORITHMS & SETTING THE ADJUSTMENT TYPE 

    When the Main Menu item Set Adjustment Type is selected, a Secondary 
Menu appears which is titled "Intensity Adjust Type". The options available 
on this secondary menu relate to methods employed by the program to change 
the intensity or luminance of the flic's palette. Before discussing these 
options in detail, it should be noted that in ALL cases, the maximum 
luminance level can not exceed 255 and the minimum cannot be less than 
zero. Thus, if the flic is using a maximum white having a luminance value 
of 255, increasing the overall luminance of the flic will NOT have any 
effect upon that white since it is already at its maximum possible value. 
The options available on the Secondary Menu are: 

    % Intensity from min. - This is the default setting for the adjustment 
          type. When this is the active intensity adjustment type, the 
          change applied is a simple percentage increase or decrease of the 
          current luminance value of the individual color register. For 
          example, if you have called for a decrease in luminance of 10% 
          and a specific color register before adjustment had a luminance 
          value of 200, the luminance value after the adjustment would be 
          180. It needs to be remembered that the actual change applied to 
          the color registers is not constant, and that the high luminance 
          values are affected more than low luminance values. A secondary 
          effect is that the overall contrast, both of the flic and that 
          possible with the palette, is lowered. This technique is useful 
          in reducing the peak luminance levels which is normally desired 
          in preparing a flic for video. Once selected, the program returns 
          to the Main Menu. 

    % Intensity from max. - When this is the active adjustment type, the 
          change applied is a simple percentage increase or decrease of the 
          difference between the current luminance value of the individual 
          color register to the maximum possible luminance level, 255. For 
          example, calling for an increase of 20% in luminance of a color 
          register having an initial setting of 55 would result in a 
          luminance change of 20, to 75 with this adjustment type. For 
          comparison, the increase would be only 6, to 61, with the 
          adjustment type set to the previous % Intensity from min. Like 
          the preceding adjustment type, this type also does not have 
          constant affect on all color registers, although unlike the 
          previous one, the affect of this type is more pronounced on low 
          luminance values. This adjustment type also does lower the 
          overall contrast of the flic and palette. It is often useful to 
          bring up the black levels to something nearer to a dark gray. 
          Using this adjustment type to increase the dark luminance levels 
          in combination with the % Intensity from min. type to decrease 
          the high luminance levels, one can reduce the contrast level of 
          a flic without changing the average luminance level. Once this 
          adjustment type has been selected, the program returns to the 
          Main Menu. 
 
    Fixed Intensity amount - When this is the selected adjustment type, the 
          change applied to the luminance level is a fixed percentage of 
          the maximum possible luminance. For example, requesting a 
          decrease of 10% will result in a constant reduction in luminance 
          value of 26 for all the color registers in a palette, subject 
          only to the constraint that it is impossible to have a negative 
          luminance. Once this adjustment type has been selected, the 
          program returns to the Main Menu. 

    Return/Cancel - Selection of this option on the Secondary Menu returns 
          the program back to the Main Menu without changing the current 
          intensity adjustment type. 

SATURATION ALGORITHM

    Changes to the color saturation levels are made on the basis of a 
simple percentage increase or decrease to the current saturation value. 
Thus, colors that are already 'gray' tend to stay 'gray'. Color registers 
in the palette that are a true gray, those with equal RGB levels or a S 
value of 0, are unaffected by changes since a 100% change in a value of 0 
is still 0. 

BUGS, PROBLEMS, and FREEware 

    I wrote this program to solve a specific problem we had trying to move 
about 50MB of flics to video tape. This program has passed its Alpha test, 
me. We use it for its intended purpose and it's working quite well. But you 
are the Beta test sites, and there is no certainty of bug free performance. 
If you find a bug and/or see improvements, let me know and I'll try and 
fix/correct/improve it. But please remember that I'm not doing this full 
time for a living... 

    Which gets around to just why I'm placing this program into the public 
domain. I don't believe that it is ethical to request money for work that 
someone else has already paid for, in this case my employer, the Naval 
Research Laboratory. Additionally, in the case of this program, the really 
tough problem - converting RGB values to HLS and vice versa - isn't my work 
to begin with. It's the result of a really super response to a question 
that I sent to Jeff Pike at Autodesk that he passed on to Grant Blaha. Add 
this all together with the fact that I can't really support it as a product 
the way I think support should be done, and it becomes down right wrong to 
ask for money. So use it, modify it, or whatever as you see fit. The only 
thing that I ask is that as a matter of professional courtesy you to retain 
some acknowledgment as to the original source. 

    I'll be happy to answer any questions. Please be advised that I read 
the Compuserve mailbox only infrequently, maybe once a week or so, so it 
would be best to direct e-mail to my normal Internet address, which I read 
at least daily. From Compuserve you can direct mail to the Internet
