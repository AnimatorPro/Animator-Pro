Revision history of the '386 fliclib.

 Version    Date    Changes

      4   09/09/91  > Ian sent off fliclib as it stands to Jim for testing

      5   09/10/91  > Jim did some testing, made the pj_raster_make_custom,
                      and pj_raster_make_compress_only set up a color map
                      in the raster they create.  Also added a few
                      underbars in function names that were missing them.
                      Added set_gs() calls to some of the pj_play_xxx
                      routines (in case they aren't using the clock).
                      Put some more test/example modules into the
                      test directory.  Dinked and fudged to get client side
                      to compile under High C (mostly had to use real types
                      instead of void * for function pointers - High C won't
                      let you mix function and data pointers or cast a function
                      pointer to void).  Redid makefiles (now have makefile.hc
                      and makefile.wc) to have an explicit rule for each .exp
                      so as to make conversion to Microsoft and other brain-dead
                      makes easier.   Shipped the whole thing to
                      Dan Silva (and via Bob Bennett to 2 other developers)
                      as fliclib0.zip.

      6   09/14/91  > Jim adds in pj_get_error_message() into the glue
                      directory.  Starts flicwish.doc which includes
                      some of Dan and Jim's suggestions after using it
                      some.  Coded up quickflc.c in the test directory.
                      Started this version.doc, backed it up as flclib06.zip,
                      and sent it off to Ian.

      7   09/14/91  > Ian changes the pj_set_gs() calls Jim added in v5 to
                      pj_clock_init() calls. The pj_clock_init() routine itself
                      was changed to return a status indicating whether the
                      clock had already been init'd.  In the gluecode routines
                      which now call pj_clock_init(), a call is made to
                      pj_clock_cleanup() upon exit from the routine, only if
                      the clock was init'd by the routine (ie, not already
                      init'd by the caller).
                    > Ian does other *massive* changes, including a complete
                      redesign of the video interface, making all raster
                      allocation functions consistantly take double-indirect
                      parms, addition of new playback and utility functions,
                      and the addition of a couple new header files.

      8  09/27/91   > Changes made by Ian... Fleshed out comment blocks in
                      all gluecode modules.  Added two new functions,
                      pj_raster_make_centered and make_offset.  These replace
                      the old center_virtual and clip_virtual functions; the
                      new ones have interfaces consistent with the other
                      raster functions.  Nuked all references to VGA_SEG,
                      PHAR_SEG, and PHAR_REAL_SEG within the code.  This
                      should allow fliclib to be used with DOS extenders other
                      than Phar Lap; the client will need to provide an
                      appropriate replacement for the util\setgs.asm module.
                      Added new function pj_cmap_update().  (Jim also added
                      pj_col_load() and col_save() in this version, and made
                      some changes/fixes in the test programs.)

      9  09/29/91   > Changes by Ian... Moved the RastlibCustom structure and
                      associated typedefs out of PJLTYPES.H and into their
                      own header, PJCUSTOM.H.  (No sense in compiling all that
                      custom groodah when a lot of folks won't be using it.)
                      Also, discarded the details of the bytemap-specific
                      fields in the FlicRaster hw union.  It turns out that
                      nothing in the gluecode needs access to this, and there's
                      little chance the client code would (or should) ever
                      touch it.  Removed typedefs of BYTE, UBYTE, etc, from
                      PJSTYPES.H; too likely to conflict with client code.
                      Everything in the other header files which used these
                      types was changed to fully-qualified integral types.
                      Fixed the logic in play_until() such that the event
                      detector routine always sees cur_frame as zero through
                      num_frames-1, regardless of the cur_loop value.  (Used
                      to go 0 thru n on the first loop and 1 thru n after
                      that.)  Fixed play_once() to stop after the last frame
                      instead of wrapping back to the 1st frame then stopping.

    10   11/08/91   > Added missing routines in rastlib dir: pj_swap_rect(),
                      and pj_xor_rast().

    11  11/30/91    > Made changes to allow fliclib to work with programs
                      compiled with the Watcom -3r calling standard.  There
                      is a separate library, FLIC386R.LIB, that can be linked
                      with a -3r client application.  The changes mainly
                      involving eliminating calls to the C runtime library
                      functions, and adding pragmas to the PJ*.H client
                      headers to define our entry-point functions as -3s style.
                      Calls to runtime lib routines were mostly eliminated by
                      a new header file for the gluecode, PJINLINE.H, that
                      defines inline code sequences for strcpy(), memset(),
                      and other common functions.  The only references to
                      runtime library functions now are to malloc(), calloc(),
                      free(), and time().  These are handled in the 3r/3s
                      fliclibs by the files RTLGLU.C and MEMGLU.C in the
                      gluecode directory.

    12  12/04/91    > Made a Watcom -3r version of fliclib.  This is
                      in the new library file FLIC386R.LIB.  The changes to
                      the source to support this were primarily in the PJ*.H
                      header files (some new pragmas), and in the GLUECODE
                      dir (new modules MEMGLU.C and RTLGLU.C).

    13  12/09/91    > Made an Intel CodeBuilder version of fliclib.  This is
                      in the new library file FLIC386C.LIB.  The changes to
                      the source to support this were primarily in the VESA
                      driver, which needed a little DOS-extender-specific
                      glue, and in SETGS.ASM.

    14  03/03/92   > Fixed a couple of bugs for Dan Silva.  Should work
                     better on flics that aren't screen sized.

    15  05/15/92   > Removed FS from #pragma modify in pjstypes.h so as to
                     better work with Watcom 9.0

    16  05/21/92   > Made pj_raster_copy() not update the color map
                     in hardware (flashy flashy) if the source and dest
                     colormaps are the same anyway.  Added pj_cmaps_same
                     into gluecode\cmapsame.c to help do this.

    17  06/15/92   > Reworked glue code to support Watcom's DOS/4GW DOS
                     extender.  Changes in vesa driver directory, and new
                     directory libsrc\glue_env (which replaces the old
                     glue_xx directories).

    18  06/25/92   > Minor modifications to makefiles and the like to
                     make QA and all the compilers happy.

    19  06/30/92   > Changed order in pj_video_all() to give VESA priority
                     over supervga.   Added new example ramflic which shows
                     how to play a flic from RAM instead of disk.

    20  07/31/92   > While porting to make a DLL, various little bugs were
                     found; the following fixes have been retrofitted into
                     this non-DLLish code as well:
                     - pj_video_get_current() didn't return proper mode number
                       because the 'modecur' variable in vdrvglue.c wasn't kept
                       up to date in pj_video_open().
                     - pj_raster_make_ram() would try to load the default
                       color map into the raster even if the allocation of
                       the raster failed (ie, pagefault city).
                     - pj_flic_create() wasn't using the results of its call
                       to pj_flic_complete_name() when creating the flic.
                     - The .INC file for making a backup wasn't getting the
                       (recently added) libsrc\glue_env & libsrc\glue_poe dirs.

	21  09/23/93  > Fixed a bug where playing a flic too large to fit on
					screen would corrupt memory if there is a FLI_COPY
					chunk.  (fixes to rastlib\grcdcomp.c and rastlib\clipbox.c)

    22  07/30/94  > Put in work-around to 3D Studio REX loader bug.
	                3DS REX loader sets static uninitialized data to
					FE rather than 0.  So I explicitly set some
					Rastlibs to zero in cboxrast, bymrast, and bitrast.c.
