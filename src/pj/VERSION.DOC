Jim - (Sent update to Ian 6/31/92 am.)
	o - Fixed bug where the translation table for small postage-stamps
	 	(less than 100x63) was 14 bytes short.   The effect of this
		bug was that small cels or flics containing any of colors 242-255
		would show up in the wrong color on the browse menu.
	o - Escape will (eventually) get you out of file selector again.
	o - HP Soft Fonts and Amiga fonts go through an ANSI-TO-OEM character
		translation table.  The effect of this is hopefully to make their
		international characters show up where the PC expects them to be.
	o - Added a -mem parameter that will control the maximum memory PJ will
		ask for.  This is all set up to accept input correctly, but currently
		will be ignored.
	o - Added a -flic parameter to load Flic on start up.  Also will load
		flic on startup if it is part of command line without a .poc 
		suffix.
	o - Rewrote help message when you type:
		ani ?
		ani -?
		ani /?

Jim - (Backed up to bernoulli 6/19/92)
	o - Changed cgroup to CGROUP in util\doserror.asm to get case sensitive
		High C linker to digest fliclib better.
	o - A few other dinky changes for Animator Support Library QA time.

Jim - (Released as PJ90 6/17/92)
	o - Fixed bug where .poe's wouldn't work with Ani Pro 1.0.

Jim - (Backed up to bernoulli 6/12/92)
	o - Made poco routine SetBlock() clip properly.
	o - Renames pj_put_rectpix to _pj_put_rectpix to indicate it does not
		clip.
	o - Added poco routines:
		"Screen  *GetPhysicalScreen(void);",
		"void    SetBox(Screen *s, int color, int x, int y, int width, int height);",
		"void	MenuText(Screen *screen, int color, int xoff, int yoff, char *text);
		"int	MenuTextWidth(char *text);",
		"int	MenuTextHeight(void);",
		"void	GetMenuColors(int *black, int *grey, int *light, int *bright, int *red);",
		"void PhysicalWaitClick(int *x, int *y, int *left, int *right, int *key);",
		"void PhysicalPollInput(int *x, int *y, int *left, int *right, int *key);",
		"void PhysicalWaitInput(int *x, int *y, int *left, int *right, int *key);",
		The intent of these is low level support for doing your own
		panels.  GetPhysicalScreen() returns the device driver 
		screen PJ uses for drawing menus as opposed to the flic.  
		SetBox sets a rectangular area to a solid color.   MenuText
		draws a string in the menu font.   PhysicalWaitClick() and related
		routines return the input in the PhysicalScreen coordinates.
	o - In palette/value/ramp if in HLS mode you'll get a rainbow'ish
		ramp instead of a flat one.
	o - Added a few more Poco routines still:
		"void	HLStoRGB(int h, int l, int s, int *r, int *g, int *b);",
		"void	RGBtoHLS(int r, int g, int b, int *h, int *l, int *s);",
		"int	ClosestColorInScreen(Screen *s, int r, int g, int b);",
		"ErrCode	SqueezeColors(int *source_map, int source_count, int *dest_map, int dest_count);"
		"ErrCode	FitScreenToColorMap(Screen *s, int *new_colors, Boolean keep_key);",
	o - Integrated a lot of Ian's Poco bug fixes.


Jim (6/4/92 backed up to bernoulli)
	o - Fixed a few spelling mistakes in bullet.poc
	o - Added some help on the F1 key (and moved pick up color to F2).
		There are 3 different help systems now.  From the home
		panel F1 will give you a list of key equivalents.  When
		editing a poco program F1 will bring up the "lookup.poc"
		program providing a list of library functions.  In other
		text editors F1 will provide a screen of help on the text
		editor.
	o - Added a few more key equivalents:
		d - toggle dither.
		k - toggle clear key color.
		v - toggle render cel over/under
		1 - toggle render cel in 1 color
		2 - toggle draw polygons in 2 colors
	o - Separated move tool into move tool and copy tool.
	o - Changed "xor" to "unzag" as one of the default inks.

Jim (6/3/92 PJ 89 released to Autodesk for alpha testing and
	backed up to Bernoulli)
	o - Made "bullet.poc", which is intended to replace "mshow.poc".
	o - Added color cluster access routines to Poco:
		"void	 SetCluster(int cluster_size, int *cluster);",
		"ErrCode GetCluster(int *cluster_size, int **cluster);",
	o - Added some more font metric routines to Poco:
		"void SetFontSpacing(int spacing);",
		"int GetFontSpacing(void);",
		"void SetFontLeading(int leadint);",
		"int GetFontLeading(void);",
		"int   WordWrapCountLines(int width, char *text);",

Jim (5/30/92 eve Backed up to Bernoulli)
	o - Fixed flex problems with Type1 fonts.  Now Palintino fonts
		are all ok, and letter forms seem to be fine in every font
		I have.  Maybe 10% of the PD fonts seem to have some
		problems with inter-letter spacing though.
	o - Made edge tool use current brush rather than always be 1 pixel
		wide.
	o - Put Type1 fonts so they draw via a cached bitmap again.  Looks
		like they all work.  Think this is a good place to ship our
		PS Type1 fonts.
	o - Added bmp into backup cycle.  Removed obsolet publib from
		backup cycle.

Jim (5/29/92 am  Backed up to Bernoulli)
	o - Some more type1 font dinking.  Found a place where it could
		close the letter without closing the shape with disasterous
		results (crashing fill_on_off) and fixed it.  Now all fonts
		I have load ok.  However a few, including the Palintino Roman
		(por_____.pfb) draw sort of funky.  It seems to be related
		to the "flex" stuff in type1.c.
	o - Integrated some of Ian's fixes to Poco (not ones downloaded
		5/28 though).
	o - Made file requestor respond a bit more like Windows one.
		If you type a wildcard or a directory into the "filename" area, 
		it will update the scrolling list of files and other fields.
		If you type in a full path name it will use it
		(ignoring the directory listed below).
	o - Split Pocosrc.inc into pocosrc.inc and poesrc.inc
