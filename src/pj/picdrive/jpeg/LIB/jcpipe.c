 * This file is part of the Independent JPEG Group's software.
 * For conditions of distribution and use, see the accompanying README file.
 *
 * This file contains compression pipeline controllers.
 * These routines are invoked via the c_pipeline_controller method.
 *
 * There are four basic pipeline controllers, one for each combination of:
 *	single-scan JPEG file (single component or fully interleaved)
 *  vs. multiple-scan JPEG file (noninterleaved or partially interleaved).
 *
 *	optimization of entropy encoding parameters
 *  vs. usage of default encoding parameters.
 *
 * Note that these conditions determine the needs for "big" arrays:
 * multiple scans imply a big array for splitting the color components;
 * entropy encoding optimization needs a big array for the MCU data.
 *
 * All but the simplest controller (single-scan, no optimization) can be
 * compiled out through configuration options, if you need to make a minimal
 * implementation.

/*
 * About the data structures:
 *
 * The processing chunk size for downsampling is referred to in this file as
 * a "row group": a row group is defined as Vk (v_samp_factor) sample rows of
 * any component after downsampling, or Vmax (max_v_samp_factor) unsubsampled
 * rows.  In an interleaved scan each MCU row contains exactly DCTSIZE row
 * groups of each component in the scan.  In a noninterleaved scan an MCU row
 * is one row of blocks, which might not be an integral number of row groups;
 * for convenience we use a buffer of the same size as in interleaved scans,
 * and process Vk MCU rows in each burst of downsampling.
 * To provide context for the downsampling step, we have to retain the last
 * two row groups of the previous MCU row while reading in the next MCU row
 * (or set of Vk MCU rows).  To do this without copying data about, we create
 * a rather strange data structure.  Exactly DCTSIZE+2 row groups of samples
 * are allocated, but we create two different sets of pointers to this array.
 * The second set swaps the last two pairs of row groups.  By working
 * alternately with the two sets of pointers, we can access the data in the
 * desired order.
