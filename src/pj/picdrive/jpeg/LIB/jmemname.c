/*
 * Selection of a file name for a temporary file.
 * This is system-dependent!
 *
 * The code as given is suitable for most Unix systems, and it is easily
 * modified for most non-Unix systems.  Some notes:
 *  1.  The temp file is created in the directory named by TEMP_DIRECTORY.
 *      The default value is /usr/tmp, which is the conventional place for
 *      creating large temp files on Unix.  On other systems you'll probably
 *      want to change the file location.  You can do this by editing the
 *      #define, or by defining TEMP_DIRECTORY in CFLAGS in the Makefile.
 *      For example, you might say
 *          CFLAGS= ... '-DTEMP_DIRECTORY="/tmp/"'
 *      Note that double quotes are needed in the text of the macro.
 *      With most make systems you have to put single quotes around the
 *      -D construct to preserve the double quotes.
 *	(Amiga SAS C has trouble with ":" and such in command-line options,
 *	so we've put in a special case for the preferred Amiga temp directory.)
 *
 *  2.  If you need to change the file name as well as its location,
 *      you can override the TEMP_FILE_NAME macro.  (Note that this is
 *      actually a printf format string; it must contain %s and %d.)
 *      Few people should need to do this.
 *
 *  3.  mktemp() is used to ensure that multiple processes running
 *      simultaneously won't select the same file names.  If your system
 *      doesn't have mktemp(), define NO_MKTEMP to do it the hard way.
 *
 *  4.  You probably want to define NEED_SIGNAL_CATCHER so that jcmain/jdmain
 *      will cause the temp files to be removed if you stop the program early.
