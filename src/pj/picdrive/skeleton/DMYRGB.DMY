A dummy pic file of type .DMY.	If you select this file while the
SKELETON.PDR is available to the host, the skeleton pdr will 'load'
this image.  Which is to say, it just clears the screen, and displays
the sequence of calls it would go through if it were really loading
an image.

This file, because it has 'dmyrgb' in the name, will cause skeleton.pdr
to use its RGB read logic instead of the normal read logic.
