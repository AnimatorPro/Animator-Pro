	If the scan phase aborts because of a seek error usually due to a chunk
	with an errant size, The attempt to later read the file after closing
	and the re-opening it the way animator does will return an errant error
	code.  This appears to be due to a bug in animator or in pharlap and 
	there is nothing the pdr can do about it.

    There is one opcode that may not be correctly parsed.  The "long comment"
	opcode.  It has an imbedded data size and I couldn't find out whether 
	the size value includes the sizeof the size integer itself or just the
	size fo the following data.  I assume it is just the size of the following
	data.

	Because of the line at a time protocal for pixel depths greater than 8 
	bits, the transfer mode and multiple chunks where the scan line order is
	not increasing from top to bottom are not implemented.

	No vector drawing operations have been implemented.
