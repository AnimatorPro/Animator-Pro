  35604 3DS        If you save a file in PJ to TIFF, or convert a     PJ76  2TK      2
                   file to TIFF using the Converter, 3D-Studio                     
                   displays this error message when trying to view                 
                   it: "Bitmap Corrupted".                                         
  34022 3DS        While attempting to use a cel created in AAP as a  75    2TK      2
                   background in 3D Studio the following problems                  
                   occur:                                                          
                                                                                   
                   1.  A cel created in AAP is always considered to                
                   be an animation by 3D Studio.  This means that                  
                   when using an AAP cel as a background the image                 
                   size of the cel must equal the image size being                 
                   rendered.  Otherwise, an error message appears and              
                   3DS does not render.  This occurs even if you get               
                   or clip a single frame cel from AAP.  A cel from                
                   AA 1.0 works fine as a background and will be                   
                   resized by 3DS if necessary.                                    
                                                                                   
                   2.  The first issue leads to this second one.  If               
                   you Cel/Clip a cel while using the 320x200 screen               
                   size in AAP, 3D Studio will not accept the cel as               
                   a background when rendering to a 320x200 image                  
                   size.  The error message says the image sizes must              
                   be equal.  If you Cel/Get a cel under the same                  
                   circumstances, getting the entire screen, the cel               
                   is accepted by 3D Studio.  Clipping must not use                
                   the same amount of image area as when you Get the               
                   entire screen.                                                  
                                                                                   
  34010 ANIMCEL    The program will crash while pasting with Sprite   74    2TK      1
                   while memory and temp space is low.  This                       
                   happened after the following steps:                             
                                                                                   
                   1.  Set up low memory and temp space.  For                      
                   example:                                                        
                                                                                   
                       386mem = 1.7mb before starting AAP                          
                       Assign one temp drive with only 200K available              
                                                                                   
                   2.  Set the screen size to 640x480, then load a 1               
                   meg 320x200 flic.  (The one I used is on megalon:               
                   /usr/spool/uucppublic/matt/intel486.zip)                        
                                                                                   
                   Load is interrupted, only part of the flic is                   
                   loaded due to lack of memory.                                   
                                                                                   
                   3.  Clip a cel using the Cel menu.                              
                   4.  Go to Animcel, select Sprite, then start                    
                   pasting the sprites to the screen until a message

                   the marquee box appears normal, the sprited                     
                   images are corrupted.  Normal paste seems OK.

                   1) Clear screen.                                                
                   2) Draw a small box.                                            
                   3) Use Cel Get to get the box and some key color

                   4) Apply current ink to entire screen.                          
                   5) Enter Anim Cel; the applied ink shows through                
                   the key color areas of cel.

                   become opaque.                                                  
                   7) Turn K button back on; the key color in cel                  
                   does not turn transparent.  Click on the screen

                   The asterisk should remain at the last menu                     
                   selection, as is the case (I believe) with the

                   flic playback speed is affected.  If the tablet                 
                   is in READY mode playback is normal, but if the

                   1) Make sure you have almost no disk space                      
                   available.

                   6) Do a DIR and check the files which were just                 
                   created.                                                        
                      They are all listed, but are empty files.                    
                      Also, no error message was displayed to alert

                   applicable tmode settings).

                   NOT be squashed while

                   squashed in Ani Pro when the screen size is set to              
                   640x480 or 800x600                                              
                   (these are the only screen resolutions I have                   
                   available at the time that                                      
                   are greater than 640x400).                                      
                                                                                   
                   3.  A 320x200 or 640x400 flic created in Ani Pro                
                   WILL be squashed while                                          
                   using Flitape with the Targa Plus, using all tmode              
                   settings, and will                                              
                   also be squashed in Ani Pro when the screen size                
                   is set to 640x480 or                                            
                   800x600.                                                        
                                                                                   
                   Jim Kent says the squashing in Ani Pro is a                     
                   hardware problem.  Not all                                      
                   displays have pixels with the same aspect ratios                
                   in all modes.                                                   
                                                                                   
                   I'm wondering why an image created in Animator 1.0              
                   will not be squashed                                            
                   in Flitape, but a 320x200 image from Ani Pro will               
                   be squashed.  Also,                                             
                   both images will be squashed in 640x480 and                     
                   800x600 in Ani Pro.                                             
  34005 FLITAPE    The Truevision VideoVGA software (vgatsr.com) and  72    2TK      2
                   the Diaquest software for the serial controller                 
                   appear to be incompatible.  While both programs                 
                   are installed Flitape will output a sequence of                 
                   flics to tape, but while attempting to use Goto                 
                   and some other features in the prompting mode, or               
                   if you change the VCR control to local then back                
                   again, the VCR will no longer respond to Flitape.               
                    If you go to DOS at this point and attempt to                  
                   control the VCR using the installed Diaquest                    
                   software, still nothing happens.

                   problem with the VideoVGA program stepping on the               
                   Diaquest program.                                               
  34016 FLITAPE    It would better if the message, "Display           75    2TK      2
                   initialization failure!", were followed by an                   
                   additional message: "Use -c to configure an ADI

  34019 FLITAPE    The total frames value is incorrect when recording 75    2TK      2
                   a looping flic.  The current value reflects the                 
                   length of a single loop rather than the entire                  
                   duration.

                   current time code position is inaccurate.  Often                
                   the current position will be around 5 frames less               
                   than the actual time code position that appears

  34021 FLITAPE    It's currently not possible to use the -c option   75    2TK      2
                   with the Interactive mode.  So, to configure a                  
                   driver, you must use -c on the command line,                    
                   along with a flic name, even though the you may                 
                   want to use the Interactive mode for recording a                
                   flic.  Would it be possible to not require a flic               
                   name to be included with -c.  Flitape -c could                  
                   just configure the driver then display the                      
                   options banner.  This way, you can easily return                
                   to the Interactive mode to record after                         
                   configuring the driver.

                   1) Using Box tool, draw an opaque box (default                  
                   options).                                                       
                   2) Select Pull Ink, draw another box overlapping                
                   the first one, and moving the mouse as you select               
                   the 2nd corner of the box (to create the Pull

                   5) Select Undo, then Redo.                                      
                   6) Pull effect is undone, but is not redone.                    
                   7) To check that it was a problem with Pull Ink                 
                   and not the Box tool, a Redo of Pull Ink was                    
                   attempted with the Draw tool as well, but it                    
                   failed.

                   1)  Select Reset from the Flic menu.                            
                   2)  Draw a large HGrad box.                                     
                   3)  Change the brush size to 10.                                
                   4)  Select Smear ink.
