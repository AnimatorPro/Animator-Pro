	o - removed xor_from_ram in vesa\device.c since this call failed the
		torture test.  Because of the way this call is used by PJ there will
		not be any errors in the operation of PJ, but the driver doesn't
		match the spec and may fail to do what some other program wants. 
		Also this call is so infrequent in PJ that there will be no significant
		difference without it.
	o - Fixed call for ferror as provided to drivers in lstdio so I could
		re make the torture program.  This was needed so Jbyers could have
		a current version of turture for the driver kit.
