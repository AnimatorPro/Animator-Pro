Here's an update of my notes, after looking over PJ51.  Could you mark this
up, indicating the items that might get implemented, and the items that
won't.  If possible, I could use something like this before tomorrow's
meeting.

Sorry this is so late, but I just managed to find and download version 51
about an hour ago.

                            PJ NOTES
 
This is an update of my PJ notes as of PJ51.  I haven't cross-
checked this with the QA buglist, so there are probably
duplications.

                       PJ Notes (12/20/90)
 
-    How _exactly_ does the new menu color system work with
     regards to forcing menu colors into the palette?
 
-    When One Color is on in the Anim Cel screen and the [C]
     button is on, each cel paste cycles the cel color.  The same
     should be true with cel pastes on the main screen, and with
     the Optics panel.
 
-    Is there something wrong with the Gel brush?  When using
     something L Grad ink with three contrasting color and the
     Dither button on, the brush seems dimmed.
 
-    [I GET A CRASH ON PJ51 WHEN I TRY TO LOAD A *.GIF AS A FLIC,
     SO I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO CHECK THIS AGAIN.] The current
     file system where PJ remembers not only the file path but
     the file wildcard mask is not really working.  First, if you
     load a *.gif as a flic, when you go into the Browse panel
     you get an error message because the Browse panel doesn't
     know about gifs.  Secondly, when you do something special
     like load a gif as a flic, it's pretty much a one time deal. 
     When you go back to load another flic, it's confusing: you
     look in the file window of the file selector and no flics
     are displayed.  After searching around through different
     directories, you suddenly realize that the *.gif button is
     still on.
 
 
                       PJ Notes (12/9/90)
 
Here are some things I discovered using the Convert program
(CONV48.EXE).
 
-    There seems to be too much green in the color conversion
     algorithm.  I captured a Vision16 .tga file from a video
     screen.  The capture was made with the NTSC Hue and
     Saturation set to zero (i.e., no color).  When the image is
     converted by Conv48, it's strongly tinted a monochrome
     green.  Likewise, when capturing a color image with the hue
     and saturation turned up, the result is a color image with a
     green tint -- no matter how the hue is adjusted in the
     capture program.
 
-    The program crashes if you cancel out of a Save Gif.
 
-    Why is there no way to do a scaled load of a grey?  Seems to
     me that Scale should be an asterisk option like Dither. 
     Since captured targa color screens really don't convert that
     well, but grey images look pretty good, I think grey
     conversions are as likely to be done as color, and it's a
     drag to have to wait for a color convertion just to get the
     proper scale.
 
-    As long as I'm wish-listing, it sure would be nice to
     convert a whole list of numerically incremented filenames
     and go away while it converts them.  Any way to integrate
     the Numpics.poc program into the convertor?  [I heard that
     the Convert program will work from the command line.  If so,
     this should take care of converting a list of filenames.  Do
     you have any specs on this?]

                             (12/5)
 
Here are some more PJ notes, questions, bugs 'n stuff:
 
-    The cel rotation angle is not displayed in the status line. 
     (It is in AA.)
 
-    Select Extra/Configure/Input Device/Custom Input Device. 
     What is this?
 
-    Bug:  Here's a bug related to forced menu colors.
 
     -    Start out with a system that does _not_ use the
          burgundy menu colors.
 
     -    Either load a picture that's mostly a single color, or
          ramp the entire 256-color matrix to a black-to-white
          gradient, then draw a large V Grad box on the screen.
 
     -    Clip a copy of the picture to the swap buffer.
 
     -    Change the menu colors to Burgundy.
 
          Result: The burgundy menu colors are forced into the
          last five registers on the palette matrix, and also
          change colors on the screen image.
 
     -    Remove all the menus and the screen image looks fine.
 
     -    Change the menu colors to use the Greys menu.
 
          Result: The old burgandy colors remain in the screen
          image (as well as the matrix), even if you remove the
          menus.  (In other words, the screen image is trashed.)
 
     -    Select Swap/View and the screen colors are restored.
 
-    The Tween screen menus contain two "Reverse" items with
     different functions (Shape/Reverse and Options/Reverse). 
     The Shape/Reverse should be renamed (though I can't think of
     a new term right now
 
-    When entering the Tools or Inks panels from the Flic drop-
     down menu, the associated Ink or Tool slot is disabled in
     the panel.  Why is this?  None of the slots are disabled on
     other panels when entered from the Flic menu.
 
-    The Streak tool should include the brush menu in its options
     box, just like the Draw and Drizzle tools.
 
-    I've been experimenting with the Trails function in the
     Tween screen as a painting technique by tweening from a
     large to a small nested, filled shape.  Most of the inks
     seem to ignore the additive effect.  Only Glaze and Jumble
     seem to increase their effect with each layer.  Is there
     some reason for this?  The Trail function could be extremely
     useful if each layer of ink were additive.
 
-    After selecting Extra/Screen Size, if you cancel, you still
     get the "new screen size" alert.  This alert shouldn't
     appear on a cancellation.
 
-    Is the "new screen size" the same as a New operation?
 
-    Can we get a [+] button on the screen snapshot file save
     box?  This would sure help when putting together
     illustrations.
 
-    Must be about time to delete the Load button from the brush
     menu.
 
-    The Pan action is inconsistent between the Zoom window
     (click-pan, like the rest of the interface) and screen pan
     (drag-pan, unlike anything else in the program).  Can
     anything be done about this, or do we document it as it
     stands?
 
-    On the Palette panel, the toggle action on the [A] and [B]
     cluster buttons is confusing.  A click on the [A] button,
     for example, should only turn on the [A] cluster.  There
     have been a number of times when I click on the [A] button,
     thinking I've turned it on, when I've actually turned it
     off.
 
-    Grid Paste is _very_ slow -- even in 320x200.  Much slower
     than in Animator.  Is this part written in Atari Basic?
 
-    How does the placement, window size, and Zoom size of the
     Zoom window affect the area to be enlarged in Effects/Expand
     X2?
 
 
                        PJ Bugs 'n Stuff
                             (PJ48)
 
Here are some bugs and notes I've been putting together while
starting rewrites on the tutorials.  There are a number of bugs
here which are not in the latest version of the QA list I just
received (11/19).   -- JP
 
-    Flic/Effects/Trails: When you do a transparent trails over a
     number of frames, then right-click to abort, after selecting
     Yes at the prompt, the trails procedure does not abort.
 
-    Insert Tween appears to be broken:
 
          -    Get a small cel, then clear all frames.
          -    Make two frames.
          -    Paste the cel at the top of frame #1, then move to
               frame #2 and paste the cel toward the bottom of
               the screen.
          -    Select Insert Tween and one of the two inserted
               guide cels will appear smeared.
 
-    Mask/Create doesn't create a complete mask when using a fat
     brush with the Draw tool.  To repeat, turn on Mask/Create
     then draw a squiggle with a large brush (say, 16).  Activate
     the mask, then draw a filled box of a different color over
     the masked area.  You'll see "cracks" in the sides of the
     drawn squiggle.
 
-    The menu colors are not maintained by the Default.fli file. 
     No matter what my colors are set to when I save a Settings
     file, when I reload the Settings file, the menu colors go
     back to the original default settings (Blues).  Also, once
     these menu colors are set, selecting Reset doesn't reset
     them to the menu colors saved by the configuration.
 
-    Tween: When Both is turned on in the Active menu, there's no
     way to know which shape is going to be replaced by the next
     drawn shape.
 
-    Tween: If you change the colors in the first or second slots
     of the mini-palette, the colors of the start and end shapes
     are not changed until after a redraw (caused by such as View
     Loop).
 
-    Tween: [Backspace] doesn't work as an Undo as it does on the
     main screen.
 
-    I've noticed that when you change a color in the mini-
     palette now, the changed color becomes the current color. 
     This is written up as a key color bug (#30611), but looks to
     be a basic change in the color selection process.  Is this a
     bug or a change in color selection procedure?
 
-    The current system of storing filenames along with paths in
     the aa.cfg file sets up a dangerous situation in which it's
     very easy to write over an existing file after rebooting the
     program.  For example, you might save a pic called
     GRAPH1.GIF, then Quit/Abandon the program.  A week later,
     you start the program up and when you go to save a picture,
     the filename defaults to GRAPH1.GIF.
 
-    For purposes of the tutorials, we need two or three easily
     identifiable colors in the mini-palette slots (besides the
     first two slots).  For example, we used to be able to tell
     the reader to select orange, or light blue, or dark red, or
     green.  Now that most of the mini-palette colors are
     designer shades, it becomes that much more complicated to
     simply tell the reader which color to pick. ("Click on Santa
     Fe Avocado Green and draw a circle...")
 
-    Here are some inconsistencies with the Anim Cel system:
 
          -    In the Cel drop-down on the main screen, we have
               "Turn."  On the Anim Cel panel, a "Rotate" button
               serves the same purpose _except_ that you can't
               click inside the cel to move it.  At the same
               time, there is a "Turn" item in the Position menu
               of the Anim Cel screen which serves a slightly
               different purpose.  I suggest changing the button
               on the Anim Cel panel to "Turn" and making
               consistent with the main Cel/Turn function so you
               can click inside the cel to move it.  In addition,
               change the "Turn" in the Position menu to
               "Rotate."
 
          -    I suggest turning off the "To Cursor" button as a
               default, since that's the method used by the main-
               screen cel and will be familiar to all AA
               upgraders.  Also, it's disorienting to have the
               cel jump around after having gotten used to moving
               cels the other way on the main screen.
 
          -    We have the term "Multi-cel" in the Time Select
               panel, "Advance Cel" in the Options menu of the
               Anim Cel screen, "Sprite" on the Anim Cel panel,
               not to mention the term "Anim Cel" itself.  Some
               of these, such as Multi-cel and Advance Cel, serve
               the same purpose.  Others are vaguely close to the
               same.  Any ideas on how to get these more
               consistent?
 
          -    [CANCEL THIS SUGGESTION] On the subject of the
               Advance Cel mode, here's a suggestion: Change the
               [K] button to something like [A] (or whatever) and
               make it an advance cel toggle.
 
          -    It would be real nice to label the frame control
               icons in the lower left of the Anim Cel panel "Cel
               Frames."
 
-    Here are some inconsistencies still floating around with
     regards to upper/lower case:
 
     -    In the Anim Cel screen: Blue Last in the Sprite option
          box.
 
     -    The f/s/a buttons are upper-case in the Optics panel
          and lower case in the Time Select panel.  Because of
          the duplicate [F] Filled and [F] Frame buttons, it
          would probably be best to make these lower case in both
          panels.
 
-    Who makes the final decision on the default menu colors? Do
     we hire a color coordinator? Personally, I prefer the Greys
     because they're neutral to any colors you might be using on
     the drawing screen, but the inactive buttons (such as Mask)
     are completely invisible in the current Gray scheme.
 
 
                         PJ NOTES (8/18)
 
-    Here's a description of the text entry fields as described
     in the 3D Studio docs.  They're based on the MicroSoft edit
     fields:
                    -------------------------
 
     When a dialog containing an editable field first appears,
     the active field is highlighted in white with red text. The
     cursor is a thin, black line.  The white block signifies
     that the field is awaiting the first keypress.  If the first
     keypress is an editing key (such as [Backface], [Home],
     cursor-arrow, and so on), or a mouse-click, the white
     background vanishes, the text turns black, and you may
     proceed to edit the field.  If, on the other hand, the first
     keypress is any valid data entry (such as [Space], or an
     alphanumeric character, the entire field is first cleared
     before editing proceeds.
 
     You can move between multiple fields in a dialog by pressing
     the [Tab] key.   In addition, the mouse clicks can be used
     to place the cursor anywhere in a field, or in any field in
     the dialog.  The following keys are used to edit text or
     move between edit fields:
 
          [Right/Left cursor] -- Move the cursor one character to
          the right or left.
 
          [Backspace] -- Delete the character to the left of the
          cursor.
 
          [Delete] -- Delete the character to the right of the
          cursor.
 
          [Home] -- Move to the beginning of the field.
 
          [End] -- Move to the end of the field.
 
          [Ctrl]-[Right arrow] -- Move one word right.
 
          [Ctrl]-[Left arrow] -- Move one word left.
 
          [Ctrl]-[Home] -- Clear all characters from the field.
 
          [Ctrl]-[End] -- Clear all characters to the right of
          the cursor.
 
          [Tab] -- Move to the next edit field.
 
          [Shift]-[Tab] -- Move to the previous edit field.
 
                  -----------------------------
 
-    The term "Key Mask" is neither descriptive nor accurate. 
     It's a matte, not a mask (and "Mask" is already used for
     another purpose in the program), and color register zero
     rather than the key color is used.  Suggest: "Custom" or
     "Matte Fli" (if it'll fit).
 
-    Add Tween buttons to all tweenable tools.  (Besides being
     handy, it tells the user which tools are tweenable.)
 
-    Shrink the height of the Pres Sens button to match other
     buttons, and rename it "Pressure."
 
-    Redesign Titling panel to look like the others.
 
TWEEN SCREEN
 
-    Add Spiral to the Shape menu.
