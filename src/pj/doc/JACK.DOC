     regards to forcing menu colors into the palette?
 
JK  Actually as you may know by now it did change when we went from 0-63
	RGB representation to 0-255.  Basically we forgot to include the factor
	of 4 in the menu visibility routines.   Now it should be like the old
	Animator which still had some problems with this, but less so.
	(Still Peter's instructions for adjusting your monitor in a standard
	way are worthwhile.)
PK  There is an algorythm that Jim designed with PJ 1.0 that attempts to check
    for "visibility".  It has not changed since then.
 
        The threshold of "visibility" has to be Improved to the best compromise
    between altering the artwork and having the menus unreadable.  We do
    have to use a reference standard for setting monitors as a performance
    standard.  The setting method below is the one I believe I should use 
    when I get to renovating this code.  I haven't gotten to this yet (in 
    the version going to the build group tomorrow) but it should be addressed
    by the next version along with the player replay key.
 
    To set up a monitor with pj:  
    
            Make an hgrad box with the (32) grey scale 
        cluster (B in the default settings) set and the hgrad dither off.
 
            The monitor contrast (video gain) and brightness
        (black level) should be set so the difference between the first color
        (color 0 as default) and the second color (darkest grey color 1) is JUST
        discernable above black.  This is very close to setting up a monitor 
        with an NAB grey scale which is a standard reference for video signals.
 
            The brightness of the brightest white highlight is set using the 
        video gain control which may interact with the black level on poor 
        monitors and an itterative approach has to be used until both are 
        correct.  The settings will be different for different ambient light 
        conditions.
 
            I put a screen of NAB color bars in the last graphics program I did
        since it is frequently recorded on the start of tapes for reference.
        Some artwork may appear inappropriate looking this way.  As with menu
        art, any other art done in video is referenced to the way the artists
        monitor and studio is set up.
        
 
-    When One Color is on in the Anim Cel screen and the [C]
     button is on, each cel paste cycles the cel color.  The same
     should be true with cel pastes on the main screen, and with
     the Optics panel.
 
PK This is a BUG send it in to Cindy as a bug and it will get in the 
    prioritized list and should get in by release.
 
-    Is there something wrong with the Gel brush?  When using
     something L Grad ink with three contrasting color and the
     Dither button on, the brush seems dimmed.
 
 PK  There is something wrong with dither.
 JK  And it's fixed in PJ54
 
-    [I GET A CRASH ON PJ51 WHEN I TRY TO LOAD A *.GIF AS A FLIC,
     SO I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO CHECK THIS AGAIN.] The current
     file system where PJ remembers not only the file path but
     the file wildcard mask is not really working.  First, if you
     load a *.gif as a flic, when you go into the Browse panel
     you get an error message because the Browse panel doesn't
     know about gifs.  Secondly, when you do something special
     like load a gif as a flic, it's pretty much a one time deal. 
     When you go back to load another flic, it's confusing: you
     look in the file window of the file selector and no flics
     are displayed.  After searching around through different
     directories, you suddenly realize that the *.gif button is
     still on.
 
PK  This seems to be working as designed.  The error message on the browse
    could be eliminated in favor of a blank current fli.  The wild card storage
    is consistent among all paths,  I'd hate to start making special cases.
JK	I think we should indeed replace the error message in browse with a
	blank flic.  It'll save us trouble when we upgrade the animator yet
	again too with an incompatible FLI format!
