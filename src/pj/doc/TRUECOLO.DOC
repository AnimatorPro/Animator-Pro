I sent this off to Barry and Eric.  Thought you might like a look at it:

Proposal for True Color Frame Animation Software
 
I. The Market
True color cards (those displaying 32000 and more colors
simultaneously) are starting to appear for less than $1000.00.  
One of the bonuses of the VGA was to equip everyone with analog
RGB monitors.  With true color we start to see a greater
interplay between the computer realm and the video realm.  I feel
it is likely that the market for a true color animator will be 2-
4x as large as the market for PJ.  While there are many technical
challenges to be met in designing and implementing such a system, 
it is likely that the transition from variable/hi-res 8 bit a
pixel frame editing to true color will be easier than the
transition from fixed/lo-res 8 bit a pixel frame editing to PJ.  
 
 
 
II. Low Level Technical Considerations
 
For an Animator style program to be effective we must first
develop real-time decompression algorithms.  Delta compression
will always work when not too much of the screen is moving, in
the worst case the speed of animation is determined by how fast
you can move an uncompressed frame from RAM (or disk) to the
display card.  For hand drawn animation six frames per second
(fps) is typically used for scenes where the motion is slow, 12
and occasionally 24 where the motion is fast.  In my experience
the traditional cel animator will be happy with 12 fps.  Computer
synthesized 3-D flybys on the other hand need 24 fps to appear
credible, and benefit from a solid 60 fps.   For video/filmed
sources I consider 15 fps near the bare minimum, and 30 adequate.
 
     Considering the small size of the traditional cel animation
market, a true color product is going to have to address 
computer synthesized or video sources.  Fortunately computer
synthesized graphics tend to have small enough changes between
frames that a system capable of displaying 15 fps of video is
easily able to display 30 fps of most synthesized imagery. 
Indeed without special compression/decompression hardware video
imagery reverts to the worst case more often than not.  So lets
look at the data rates required for 15 fps uncompressed images:
 
 Display       Resolution     Depth (bits)   Data Rate (byte/sec)
VGA/MCGA        320x200        8                960,000
Super VGA 256K  640x400        8              3,840,000
Super VGA 512K  640x480        8              4,608,000
8514/A         1024x768        8             11,796,480
NTSC            512x240       16              3,686,400
NTSC Interlace  512x480       16              7,372,800
Better NTSC     512x480       32             14,745,600
HDTV           1024x960       32             58,982,400
 
     The most popular "hi-res" mode of PJ is likely to be 640x480
since this matches the 16 color resolution people have come to
love in their VGA cards.  As you can see a minimal resolution but
still suitable for NTSC video-taping would have a _lower_ data
rate than hi-res PJ.  Even the shift from PJ resolution to the
relatively hi-end 512x480 32 bit-a-pixel resolution would be
roughly a 3x increase in data (as opposed to the 5x increase we
had coming from VGA/MCGA resolutions.)
 
     Though in truth PJ does not keep up with Autodesk Animator
frame rates in the high resolutions, it does come close.   We
achieved this by sending data to the video card 16 bits at a time
instead of 8.   In the time between the Animator release and PJ's
release the clock speed of your 'power' PC nearly doubled.  As a
result we managed to nearly break even!  I imagine clock speeds
will continue to go up, and that 32 bit buses will become more
common in the next 12-18 months.  So with luck when a true color
product is ready for release we will be able to maintain frame
rates even at the better NTSC resolutions.
 
III.  Hardware Assisted Compression and Decompression
 
     PJ manages to do a credible job of full-screen animation in
hi resolutions when playing back from RAM.  However even from a
very fast hard disk animation with large deltas are slow at best,
and often embarrassingly jerky.   One reason is disk speed has
not advanced at the rate that memory speed has, also the faster
disks already had 16 bit data paths at the time of the Animator. 
 Though personally I'd rather see a breakthrough in mass storage
technology, and EISA controllers with 32 bit interfaces, 
hardware image compression and decompression devices provide
another solution that at the moment looks a bit more likely in
our time frame.  
 
     I know of several hardware image compression efforts in
various stages.   There is the much talked about DVI effort.  I
am a bit skeptical of this one.   This started out as the work of
a small design team at Sarnoff (sp?) Labs. From what I can tell
the early work was quite good.  However it was done using silicon
compilers with the naive hope that the design could be hand
polished and speed tweaked in a timely manner without introducing
lots of bugs.  This is somewhat akin to thinking that the output
of a C compiler is a good place to start for developing maximally
efficient assembler code, and I can tell you it just isn't so!  
Better to work at a higher level and wait for the processes to
get faster underneath you in the meantime.   At any rate DVI was
developed by a small group who weren't tied to any particular
computer architecture.  Their prototypes (for expedience sake
from what I can tell) were mounted on boards that could slot into
a PC.  Bill Gates and the good folks with vested interest in the
IBM PC architecture were in dire need of an answer to the CDI
threat (see below).  They latched onto DVI, trumpeting it to the
press while it was still very much in the experimental stage.  
Meanwhile the DVI group was moved first to Princeton, and later
to Silicon Valley.   One wonders how many of the designers
survived the changes in management and the moves.   The target of
DVI, a read only medium with a data transfer rate not that much
better than high density floppies, is quite unlike the
interactive editing environment associated with the Animator. 
The color fringing and other artifacts introduced in the
compression process make DVI no better to the video producer than
straight analog NTSC (but with lower resolution).  Intel heard
some of our problems with this medium when we met with some of
their DVI management slightly before the release of the Autodesk
Animator and,to their credit,seemed concerned.  They offered no
solutions beyond --"well it is microcodable."   Given the amount
of money and press spent on DVI I suspect we will be hearing of
it for quite some time, but I frankly doubt it will be of use to
us in a true color frame editor.
 
Predating DVI is CDI (Compact Disk Interactive).   This is
envisioned as a keyboard-less computer more like a video-game
console than a PC which will, incidently, play back audio CD's. 
Sony, Phillips, and other extremely large corporations have been
working on it for some time.  It looks like a well-designed
system, though again four years after the big excitement in the
press it has yet to find it's way into consumers hands.  It is
based on a 68000 compatible processor running OS-9 (which is a
multi-tasking operating system I have a bit of experience with). 
There is also a (more modest) image decompression chip set which
has a mode that could, charitably, be described as true color. 
The original chip set could do run-length decompression.  Later
seeing the Antic Cyber stuff, Zoetrope, Dpaint III, and, indeed,
talking to myself, they implemented delta decompression first in
software and now I hear in hardware as well.   The true color
mode is 9 bits a pixel, and uses a color model closer to NTSC
than RGB, though I've forgotten the details.   (It is better than
HAM on the Amiga though!)   
 
A company well worth watching is Compression Labs.  I don't know
many details, but they have been making compression components
for video-phones for several years now, and seem quite stable and
on the ball.   Their work that I've seen has been black and
white, with a relatively low frame rate, and lo res to boot.  But
they do compress and decompress in real time, and squeeze it down
enough to go over a phone line. 
 
C-Cubed also is very far along in some digital video compression
chips.   Since you probably know more about them than I do I'll
omit the details here.  Perhaps you can fill me in on it later.
 
How exactly our true color frame editing software will relate to
these hardware image compression engines is hard to say without
working directly with these chips.    In PJ I put the
decompression routines onto drivers which are loaded by PJ, and
can be developed by third parties.   I made the decision to keep
the compression side on the host.  (This makes it easier to
interchange files and makes the drivers less complicated,  but
means that hardware assist has to be tailored to our format.)  In
the true color system I will put both the compression and the
decompression into the driver so that the driver can format the
data to be as fast as possible with a particular set of hardware. 
 It's my feeling that for at least the first couple of years of
release this hardware is going to be either an 80486 or a TI
34010 or 34020 for most people.  (The 34010 is a microprocessor
with an instruction set especially handy for graphics.  It turns
out it does Limpel Zif Welch (arc-type) and Huffman decoding much
faster than a traditional microprocessor as well.  We'll see soon
how fast it can decompress PJ-formatted Flic's, Jake Richter and
TIGA 2.0 willing.)   Given the changing state of hardware
compression, loadable drivers is the best way to handle these
chips at the present time.
 
 
IV.  Adaptation of PJ to True Color
 
Adapting PJ to true color will proceed in several phases.  First
we need to devise a file format and associated 80386 compression
and decompression routines.   This will probably take one to two
months and should be started as soon as possible.  If we manage
to devise even semi-credible frame rates on today's hardware I
would say it'd be easy to sell Autodesk on the rest of the
project.   Possibly we can work on 34010 assisted techniques
during this stage.  (There's a 34010 in the Hercules Graphics
Station Card which is currently one of the cheapest ways to get
into true color.)
 
The next phase is to bring up a true color PJ with no changes to
the user interface.   This'll probably take around three months.
 
The third phase would be to bring the benefits of true color to
the user.  The Palette Panel will, of course, need extensive
reworking.  It'd also be desirable to incorporate 'object based'
antialiasing rather than post-process antialiasing (lines that
are drawn with soft edges rather than smoothed out by the user as
a second operation.)  We will, I assure you, think of many other
features that are suddenly easy to implement in the context of
true color, and desirable to the user.   I would like, if
possible, to get Dan Silva to work with us during this phase,
which should be allotted at least three months.
 
Finally we need to consider features such as outline fonts,
better titling in general,  communication with the 3-D software
(which works naturally better in true color than in 256 color),
and, God bless us, whatever ADI has turned into by then.   Add
three months for these types of features, three or four months
for QA and we should be ready to sell the product.
 
V. Conclusion
 
A true color frame editing system to be released in 12-18 months
looks in my mind a good deal more feasible than PJ ever was.  I
believe it will benefit more from synergy with our 3-D software,
and make more use of video image sources than anything we've seen
yet.   In short, I feel we should embark on the initial stages of
developing compression formats immediately, possibly using Jim
Mackraz, Eric Lyons, or myself.   We may want to put off later
stages until we see how PJ does, but I am confident that a true
color product will do much better than the hi-res 256 color one.
