        The threshold of "visibility" has to be Improved to the best compromise
    between altering the artwork and having the menus unreadable.  We do
    have to use a reference standard for setting monitors as a performance
    standard.  The setting method below is the one I believe I should use 
    when I get to renovating this code.  I haven't gotten to this yet (in 
    the version going to the build group tomorrow) but it should be addressed
    by the next version along with the player replay key.

    To set up a monitor with pj:  
    
            Make an hgrad box with the (32) grey scale 
        cluster (B in the default settings) set and the hgrad dither off.

            The monitor contrast (video gain) and brightness
        (black level) should be set so the difference between the first color
        (color 0 as default) and the second color (darkest grey color 1) is JUST
        discernable above black.  This is very close to setting up a monitor 
        with an NAB grey scale which is a standard reference for video signals.

            The brightness of the brightest white highlight is set using the 
        video gain control which may interact with the black level on poor 
        monitors and an itterative approach has to be used until both are 
        correct.  The settings will be different for different ambient light 
        conditions.

            I put a screen of NAB color bars in the last graphics program I did
        since it is frequently recorded on the start of tapes for reference.
        Some artwork may appear inappropriate looking this way.  As with menu
        art, any other art done in video is referenced to the way the artists
        monitor and studio is set up.
