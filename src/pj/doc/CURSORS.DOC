
The best way to make a color palette with the menu colors in the last 5 is:

	- Start with a reset default fli (one frame)

	- Select the menu palette you want to use.

	- Do a "one palette" operation from the palette menu.
		This has the side effect of forcing all colors to black
		since no colors are used in the fli.  It will also force the
		current menu palette into the last 5 colors (251 to 255)

	- Set color 250, the one just before the menu colors, to something
	 	visible that is obviously not one of the menu colors.
		This is the color that the cursor uses to represent the current
		pen color.  The one palette should have left this the selected
		color if you started from a reset fli.

	- Design your cursor using that color set, all other colors are clear.
		I find having a zoom window open with a fairly big scale
		next to the actual size design a help, especially when you
		pick the HOT spot.

	- CLIP the design as a cel or otherwise get it so it is as small a
		rectangle as possible and still contains the image (saves ram in pj)
	
	- From the Cel Tools menu go to save cursor in the pull down
		It will promp you to pick the "hot" or active spot on the
		New design in the cel.  After this you will get a file name
		save requestor.  Save it to the cursor you want it to be.
		The next time PJ is started from the command line the new
		cursor will be loaded and used.
