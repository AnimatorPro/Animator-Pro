
Peter & Jim integration time (released as PJ 64)
FEATURES CHANGES:
	o - "Grey" becomes "Gray" again, much to the delight of Mr. Gray.
	o - Default menu colors changed from blues to grays.  Mr. Gray is
		very excited about this and wants to invest in Multimedia stock.
	o - Palette/Menu Colors changed around and gray ends up on top of
		blue.   Revisionist history of the Civil War?  I'm not authorized
		to comment on this say General Lee at a press conference.
Peter -
BUG FIXES:
	o - 33510 NAB. This is simply because the menus are up and the menu colors
		have co-opted the entry in question. right clicking to remove the 
		menus will turn off the menu color.
	o - 32684 I renamed all Gray to Grey because there were both.  I 
		personally am used to grey.  I looked it up here. Gray is listed as 
		the most common US spelling but fading (Those Chicago "AAAAA"s I 
		guess) with Grey as a close second usage.  Grey is almost exclusively
		used outside the US.  Compound words are incorrect with gray as in
		greyhound. I would say if grey is ok in the US and the Europeans 
		and Aussies say grey is preferrable and they mean it, I'll go with
		grey.
	o - ERRORMSG I did change some low level stuff that might effect these
		bugs, I havn't tested all of them and it would be easir for you to 
		do so.
	o - 30671 This maybe should be changed. Not the font but how we handle
		it. This font is designed with no lower case letters in it. Should
		we allow entry of lower case and display them as caps? and vice versa
		for fonts with no lower case?  We had a complaint about seeing one
		thing in one font and another thing somewhere else.
	o - 30667 Fixed.
	o - 30666 Fixed. Point field removed.
	o - 32684 All instances of Gray and gray in aa.mu were switched to
		Grey and grey.  I hope Mr. Gray approves.
	o - 30655 Fixed??  This is a very difficult one to call. It depends on how 
		your monitor is set up and what the picture is under the cursor.
		There are other menu color choices for those who don't like it. 

			I have changed it a little in a way that makes the cursors more
		visible on dark backgrounds, but it suffers some on light ones.
		This palette is an example of one someone might use in a darkened
		room and working on images with dark backgrounds.  In this way
		the menus don't so severly contrast with the art that you can't
		see what you're working on.  Many people will use several menu color
		sets depending on what type of artwork they are doing.  More subtle
		color sets are likely to be inappropriate for a greater range of
		artwork, and our palette fitting accentuates this a bit.  
		
			The safest general set for use with a wide variety of art are 
		the greys and blues palettes since they don't rely on subtle color to 
		differentiate one part of a menu from another.  They rely solely
		on the brightness and contain a full range.  Some people, however,
		do not wear grey suits even though it may be the most practical thing
		usable for the greatest number of occasions. They have several and
		change them when appropriate.  We should in addition to what is safe
		offer a little peek at what is possible.

	o - Editor cursor remains confined to edit window. (see features changes)
	o - Browse now does more checking for corrupt files.
	o - Right Justify and fill and center justify now do their thing more
		accurately. Right justify would be ragged at times in word wrap and
		so would fill.
	o - 30679 Fixed. Zoom window drag bar now works in text editor.
	o - 30454 Fixed.
	o - "Blue last" changed to "Blue Last" in cel menu.
	o - In font requestor, When the load of a font fails in all cases now,
		The previous font is re-loaded if possible.
	o - Out of range typed in input on font requestor will now bring up same
		error message as brought up in Join menu for boxil size, etc.
	o - Right click on file menu buttons will select them and then call
		whatever else they do like going to the pdr menus.
	o - Hls/Rgb, cluster A/B, and Cluster/All, buttons returned to "Radio
		button protocall.
	o - Renamed cel menu "Turn/Rotate" so all are "Turn" and the pull down in 
		the cel menu is "Rotate"
	o - 30669 Fixed.  Big improvements on handling of fonts with interleaved
		character formats.  Also fixed Bard font which was a worst case for 
		this type of font.
	o - 30454 Status coordinates now displayed when moving text window.
	o - Macro menu is now taken down when a macro is finished executing.
		But it stays up when a macro being recorded is ended.
FEATURES CHANGES:
	o - When getting colors in the Palette menu, the ends of find ramp etc.
		the color index number is now additionally displayed on the status 
		line.
	o - Editor cursor change: In insert mode it is a thin verticl bar that
		is as close as fhe font provides, to being between the two characters
		where the new one will be added. This seems to be standard on other
		variable font editors out there. In overtype mode, e half height 
		vertical bar as in insert mode and an underbar under the character 
		to be overwritten ( "L" shape is displayed.) If insert mode is at the
		end of the file or at a carraige return it will display a broken 
		vertical bar resembling a big ":" (colon) immediately after the last
		character of the line or file.
	o - Color palette changed to be animator 1.0 palette given to me by Jim.
	o - Instead of putting up a requestor when a fli file is being queryed
		to build the browse, the text "Can't Read!" is placed in the postage
		stamp box.  Any action other than delete will display the full
		error message at that time.
	o - "Nesting" Icon added to zoom settings menu. Part of bug fix to allow
		zoom window moving and dragging in text edit mode.
	o - Font menu spacing and leading requestors now dynamicly vary displayed
		font in font window on requestor. Just looks better.
	o - Added right click to bring up number requestor in font menu for 
		both leading and spacing fields.  This for more consistency with
		other menus. Left click still does what id did before.

FEATURES CHANGES:
	o - TIFF PDR saves LZW compressed too.

Jim 
BUGS:
	30678 - NAB.  Escape key doesn't paste text in text tool edit
		    either.   The Escape key finishes your editing session.  If
			you're in a mode where after editing text you paste it, yes
			the text gets pasted then.   In the titling menu by design
			the only place text shows up on your picture is when you
			render it.
	30830 - NAB.  If your current drawing color is the same as the background
			color indeed you will not see anything during Tween/View.
			However since you would not see anything during Tween/Render
			this is an honest preview.
	32653 - NAB.  In tween when Active/Both is selected, when you draw a
			shape it alternates between being the start shape and the end
			shape.   Undo has no effect on this.   So yes, you can 
			draw the start shape, undo, then draw the end shape.  However
			this is just like we designed it.
	32656 - NAB.  In tween if the start and end shapes are the same they
			will be drawn on top of each other with the appearance that
			there is only one shape.   But there are *always* two shapes
			in tween.   People will get used to this.   It is operating
			as designed.
	32657 - NAB.  See explanation for 32656.  When you create the first
			polygon in a tween,  it automatically becomes the start and
			end shape both.   This is useful when you want the end
			shape to be a distortion of the start shape.  In short, yes
			this is the way it is supposed to work.
	32665 - Fixed.  Tween/Inside-Out on open polys fixed in PJ61 actually,
			but we got a truncated bug list so didn't have the number. 
			Sorry.
INTERNAL CHANGES:
	o - changed convert.lnk so that libraries would come from the
	    \build directory instead of off c:\wc386.
	o - removed "set tmp = h:" line from \build\setwc386 as there
		is no such ram-disk on the new AST "prebuild" machine.
	o - moved final "beep" up two lines in make.bat so wouldn't get
		"command not found" during very last bit of a build.
FEATURES CHANGES:
	o - Got rid of double cryptic error message when no mouse installed.
	o - Made exit() function in poco not report an error if positive.
	o - Increased default leading of amiga fonts.
	o - Added 'r' for render and 'p' for preview key equivalents in the
		time select panel.   Also 'f', 's', 'a' for frame/segment/all.
	o - vram4.drv doesn't end up in the resource directory anymore.
	o - hgsc.drv doesn't end up in the resource directory anymore.

Jim - (Released as PJ63 to build group)
FEATURES CHANGES:
	o - Removed "points" section of font requestor.
	o - "Grey" menu colors RGB values same as in Animator 1.0.

Peter - 03-11-91 07:56:57 (Code given to Jim)
BUG FIXES:
	o - If the mask button is on in a settings file and the file is loaded
		without a mask present the use_mask flag is negated in the loaded 
		settings. make_mask is also checked in a similar manner.
	o - 33553 I believe it is fixed.  I was unable to make it happen here.
		Please re-test on most recent pj 61 or higher. Thanks.
	o - 32682 Fixed.
	o - 32213 (See 32212)
	o - 32212 Due to the limitations of the hardware and the fli file format
		this will NOT be changed.  You will notice that loop segment will
		hesitate the FIRST time.
	o - 32638 Fixed.
	o - 30455 NAB.  If one has saved the menu colors in a default.set file
		as the defaults.  Reseting to the defaults will always return you
		what is saved in the default.set file. In the absense of a default.set
		file the menu colors are preserved on a reset.
	o - 32236 Fixed.
	o - 30439 Fixed.
	o - 33556 The macro system pays NO attention to what state pj is in when
		they are started.  Macros will sense whether the program is asking for
		the input as it was recorded and will abort if they get out of sync.
		Macros won't pay attention to where the windows are, what tools
		are up, states of buttons, inks etc etc.  The best thing to do is to 
		either save the settings and load the settings as the first item in 
		the macro or do a reset.  Otherwise you must start from a known proper
		state. It is a very primative low level system primarily there to aid
		in QA.
	o - 32678 Fixed.
	o - 32679 Fixed. copy_in_file() will now expand file if need be.
	o - 32237 Fixed.
	o - 32651 Fixed as of pj60.
	o - 32611  I'm content with Ani.  If you get all the powers at be together
		an get a good Idea for a 5 (That's FIVE) letter or less word to put in
		place of ani let me know. The change is simple.
		Comment from Jack Powell:
			Until the "powers that be" come up with a product name, there's 
			no point in even discussing this bug.
	o - 32229 Fixed.
	o - 33558 Fixed a while back.  Unsuccessdul load will now always
		revert to the previous font or "=ram6by6.fnt" if all else fails.
	o - 30665 There is no difference between this and any other file selector
		The entry field scrolls to reveal the whole thing.
	o - 30665 Changed, path now right justified so leading part is truncated.
		At least this is better.
	o - 33549 Fixed. (see 32687)
	o - 33527 Try this again with later version.  It works here.
	o - 32215 Fixed as of PJ 61
	o - 33506 Pj will not detect if your monitor is plugged in or not.
		Neither can the 8514.  If everthing was OK when you had the monitor
		in the right port, the problem is not with PJ.
	o - 32687 Fixed. One change is now recorded for each frame of the
		joined transition, and one change for a "Cut" transition.
	o - 30683 Fixed.  Enter key now saves/loads file as in name field.
		The '+' key will now execute the increment first operation then 
		save or load.
	o - 30674 Fixed. displays "can't load" message now.
	o - 32228 NAB. The extention on the pic save file requestor is determined
		by the pic saveing PDR selection currently extant.  This selection
		is made by right clicking on the "Picture" button on the file type
		panel.  This is different than animator 1.0.
	o - 32227 Fixed.
	o - 32225 Fixed.
	o - 30650 Fixed. Key chaged to 'L' and L is underlined.
	o - 32220 This has been made consistent all items with the 'A' in them
		such as "load a flic" have had the 'a' removed. IE: "load flic".
	o - 30647 Wishlist.  The cursor path is not saved.  The ability to save 
		cursors will be a VEREY seldom used feature and the wasted memory
		for saving the path in all settings files etc. was thought unneccessary.
	o - 33517 Fixed (see 33516)
	o - 32630 Fixed.
	o - 33407 Fixed.
	o - 32648 Changed. The expand by two now is done by moving a marqueed box
		to the proper spot.
	o - 30682 Dos bug.  The pause key you will find will "hang" the program
		in whatever mannor it is hit and whenever it is hit. This appears
		to be trapped by dos and the program has no knowledge of it. It's
		a bit insidious.  Control pause seems on my machine to halt all
		keyboard input.
	o - 30680 NAB  The cursor DOES stay in the same column BUT if the font
		has characters that vary in width the "numeric" column is not 
		in the same location on every line.  This may not be like some other
		variable width font desktop publishing editors but it does work.
	o - 30681 NAB  PJ only loads cursors from the resource directory.
		In the example the cursor was saved to another place.  When the
		cursor is placed into the resource dir all is well.
	o - 32681 Fixed.
	o - 32660 NAB aa.mu is required for program operation. If it is not found
		the program can't run.  Since it contains all the text the message
		was printed in several languages.
	o - 32676 This bug is obsolete but a valid comment.  The file default.fli
		is now the file "default.set"  The nomenclature of "default.flx" is
		a question for what the doc people want.  Default.flx refers to the 
		state of the "flx" (current flic) that will be set up in pj.
Peter - 03-08-91 11:16:15 (code given to Jim and returned to Peter)
FEATURES CHANGES:
	o - All names on paths when loaded as the default settings via a reset
		to defaults or startup after abandon are set to "unnamed" with the
		exception of the font path so the selected font is re-loaded on
		a reset startup.  Path names loaded via an explicit loading of 
		a settings record are left the way they were saved.
BUG FIXES:
	o - #33414 There are very few scenarios where one would be unable to load
		the browse selection as a fli or cel.  The browse menu and all it's
		imagery is trashed BEFORE the new fli is loaded and all the system 
		memory de-fragged at this point.  To re-load the browse would take
		the same ammount of time as the initial load of the browse display 
		and it was elected not to waste the time.  If it is really important
		we can change it, but I feel it unneccessary.

	o - #32686 Improved. The colors used for the status bar when no menus
		are up have been improved.  However, a decision was made to prevent
		the presence of a status bar from taking over palette colors to be
		visible, so, in some conditions it will be less than optimal.

	o - #33412 Changed. The path in the browse is not an entry field so does
		not scroll.  It has been changed to always insure that the right
		end of the path is visible and that the left end is truncated 
		instead.

	o - #32675 Fixed. Now reports "Cel stretch failure"
								  "Object too big to handle"
	o - #32671 Fixed. Postage stamp code didn't handle 1 pixel wide OR high
		compressions.

	o - #32672 NAB This is the way ALL the over time operations work.

	o - #32670 Fixed, when the values for the cursor position are outside 
		the active window "? ?" is now displayed as the coordinate position.

	o - #32669 NAB  The representation of the cel's position was changed
		from the position of the cel's upper left corner, to the position
		of the cel's center.  This was important since the cel may now
		remain in a scaled or rotated state.  In animator 1.0 the cel 
		when stretched was pasted once and the scaled state of the cel
		was not preserved.  Actions done to the cel are done relative to it's
		center.

	o - #32616 Fixed. The menu layout has been changed since pj48.

	o - #33406 Fixed. The "file doesn't exist" text has been changed to 
		"file not found"

	o - #33550 Yep, your right, it isn't that simple see 33551

		The orientation altering bug in example 'B' where the stretch 
		with both axes negative caused the orientation of the cel to change
		has been fixed and the orietation will now remain the same. This should
		make things a little less murky.

		One can make a cel "mirrored" by "stretching" a cel so that one 
		of it's scale factors is negative. Un-mirror will undo this condition.

		The purpose of un-stretch is to return the cel to it's original SIZE.
		hopefully without changing the rotation or position of the cel.

		if one of the scale factors is negative it is assumed that the 
		"mirrored" condition is wished to be preserved, only the size changed.
		and the negative scale factor will be made -100% to preserve the
		mirroring.  If both scale factors are negative, the cel is rotated 
		180 degrees and the scale factors made 100% and 100%

	o - #33551 The un-mirror operation was requested a while back.  Since
		there really isn't a "mirrored" state, it isn't really easy to decide
		how to "un-mirror" something.  The mirror operation calculates a 
		combination of scaling (stretching) and rotation (turning) to produce
		a result that is the mirror of what was there before.  Since all
		the operations are cumulative the result of un-mirror will not always
		be what is expected.  It will however always return the cel to a state
		where its four sides are in the order it was created in, even though
		it may be rotated differently from it's original position.  This is 
		one reason the restore operation is there which will return you to the
		original.  There is also undo which will always return you to where 
		you were before the last operation.  Un-mirror will have some  
		ambiguity in it's result.   The un-mirror algorythm is like this:

			If the scale factor along X is negative invert it.
			If the scale factor along Y is negative invert that.
			If both were negative, rotate the cel by 180 degrees and 
			keep the orientation expected.

		When doing a mirror about an axis you will probably get different 
		results depending on the order in which you specify the end points
		of the axis. The arbitrary axis algorythm is quite messy and will
		not perform the same operation as the explicit X axis mirror or 
		Y axis mirror even if the axis is along X or Y.  Mirroring about
		an arbitrary axis will also, if the axis doesn't go through the center
		of the cel move the cel's position.  Position changes are NOT altered
		by the un-mirror so you won't get the same thing as undo.  In fact, 
		except in the very simple cases un-mirror will almost never return
		you to the state immediately before the "mirror" operation.  The only
		thing it is guaranteed to do is to place the cel's sides in the order
		they were in when it was created and make both scale factors positive.

		Mirroring about an arbitrary axis actually always inverts the Y 
		scale factor and then rotates the cel to give it an orientation making
		the result visually mirrored about the axis specified.

	o - #33526 Fixed.  Note the "Sprite" tool is NOT active in the inks menu
		and the tool button is blank.  This is because the sprite tool can't
		be used here.

	o - #33411 NAB This was a change from animator 1.0.  ALL directorys
		have a trailing '\' after them, this differentiates a directory from a 
		full path name for a specific file visually.  There should never be
		a directory field without the '\' on the end. The missing '\' was a bug.

	o - #40442 Semantics.
		Personally I would take the turn of calling all "displace angularly
		about an axis" operations "rotate"s which is the most common and 
		unambiguous word for describing this action.  This would make PJ more
		consistent with other products in the industry, autocad, and 3d studio.
		The use of the word "Turn" over "rotate" was only used because 
		the key equivalent scheme for the pull downs in Animator 1.0. This so 
		the  key would be "T" instead of "R" which would conflict with 
		"Release", and that turn is 4 letters where rotate is 6 for fitting 
		into the optics mode button.  
		
		For the sake of making the documentation
		job easier I have changed all the rotate/turn operation buttons and
		menus to be labeled "Turn" even though this is non-standard and not the
		best use of language.  Turn in many cases means to redirect a forward
		motion, force, or train of thought, as well as to rotate about an axis.

	o - #32674 NAB?? This was the way I decided to do it.  Since the buttons
		in question only SELECT a mode but do not perform any ACTION actually
		requiring the cel I left them active.  This does allow the user some
		flexibility in the "syntax" of how he may think while improvising.

		ie: "I want to STRETCH a cel that I CLIP from over here. "

		If the buttons were all disabled you would be forced to think 
		of it ONLY as "I have to CLIP this over here as a cel then STRETCH it."

		I would have left the other modes active but the actual selection
		process requires the presence of the cel and it was not possible.

		Since once a cel is freed from memory by the "release" function it is
		truely gone from this world in cel heaven, restore is disabled.

	o - #32685 NAB.  Alas pj operates in a 256 color environment. In order to
		make the menus visible, the colors of the palette must be searched to 
		find the most appropriate colors. If the palette changes while menus
		are displayed, the menus must be re-drawn in the appropriate colors.
		The refresh of the menus takes time and causes the menu to flash colors
		when this occurs.  Try loading any fli with a lot of palette changes
		and step through the frames.  The menus will flash.  The animator
		1.0 got around this by always removing all menus whenever the any 
		action was taken annoyingly flashing the menus all the time.  I think
		the automatic redraw system is better.

		The color changes in the flic itself are dure to the imperfect nature 
		of trying to squeeze the appropriate colors as closely as possible
		to the available palette.  Rather than changing the colors in one big
		VERY obvious pop the changes are spread out over the number of frames
		of the overlap between the two flics.  This code is unchanged from 
		the way it was in animator 1.0.  It is also possible that the menus
		are taking over the last 5 colors to be visible which will also make
		visible changes in the flic.  The real test is to play the flic and
		see how the result is after the composit and whether the result 
		approximates what is desired.

	o - #33409 NAB.  If one enters the browse menu to browse flics anything
		displayed in the browse list is loaded as the current flic, the suffix
		is irrelevent.  If any image file type is loaded from the file menu 
		when loading the flic, whether it is a flic, a cel, or a picture, it
		will be loaded as the current flic.

		The same is true when loading an image file as the current cel, whatever
		is selected will be loaded as the cel NOT the flic.  It is not what
		is loaded but in what it is loaded as that determines it's use.

		Personally I would put the flic "browse" pull down entry under "flic" 
		instead of under "ani" in the main pull down. It would make more sense.

	o - #32408 NAB.  In this case you have loaded the file as the current 
		flic NOT as a cel.  This will re-configure the flic window to the size
		of the file as designed.  When a reset is done, unless an explicit 
		change to the size is made, the size will remain the same.

	o - #32673 NAB.  This is by design.  During the scan phase where all frames
		of the segment in question are scanned to find the largest clip, 
		the action is displayed.  When clipping cels from large flis the scan
		time can be quite significant.  We could have made it invisible but
		during a long scan it is better to give someone something to look at
		rather than making the machine appear to freeze while the operation is
		taking place.

	o - #33550 The ability to move the cel in the turn/rotate mode in the old 
		animator is incompatible with the abilities of pj.  It is possible with
		pj to load a cel that is larger than the screen.  It would be 
		impossible to turn/rotate it if the "move when clicking inside" ability
		was present in the anim-cel menu modes.  I personally would prefer to
		eliminate the ability to move the cel by clicking inside it.  It was
		left in PURELY for compatablity with animator 1.0.  Likewise it would
		also be appropriate to re-do the interface for scale/stretch actions
		to be easier as well, but the changes necessary would have made the 
		scaling interface act vastly different than animator 1.0 and it was 
		decided not to change it.  One frequently pays in consistency when 
		adding capability AND maintaining compatablility with previous 
		versions that were not designed with the demands of the new capability
		in mind.  We might have been better off scrapping the old interface
		design, but we are stuck with it now and don't have time to re-write
		the docs.

	o - #33526 Alas, mouse keys are not buffered in the pj input scheme. It
		would be nice if they were.  If the previous operation is not finished
		before the click is released the click will be lost.  This is in part 
		due to the way the microsoft mouse works and in part our design.  It 
		would require a fundamental re-write of the input section of the 
		program.  You will find the same problem with the gel brush and other
		large pasted items as well, but, since the gel brush is not numbered
		you don't notice it right off.

	o - #33525 I was unable to find a problem.  What I did is as follows:
		steps 1 to 4..
		First click on screen picks up cel but does NOT paste it or increment it
		which is as designed.
		Second, and subsequent clicks paste cel on screen, and advance cel to
		the next frame with mouse both stationary or moved as designed.  
		I repeated this several times.
	o - Blue numbers put an extraneous character after the number. This has 
		been fixed.
	o - #33524 (see 33522)
	o - #33540 (See 33522)
	o - #33522 Color cycle button now has right click disabled when overlay
		records (sprite mode) are present.
	o - #30814 Has been fixed for a while.

INTERNAL CHANGES:
	o - Some improvements made to error handling of low level dos io
		functions.
	o - If the pre initialization call made when opening a video driver
		returns "Err_no_display" the driver will be ignored when making the
		directory listing in the screen mode directory.

Jim - (Code back to Peter)
	o - Added "cfig386 -minreal 4096" line to "make release" batch file.
		This will make sure that there's 64K of low (lower 640K) memory
		for things such as the VESA driver and POE modules intefacing
		to wierd things, ADI, etc.
	o - During startup (init_screen) the GS segment register gets set
		to point to the lower meg of memory.   (It speeds up some of
		the drivers to be able to assume this.)

Jim - (Code released to Build group as PJ61)
	o - Changed suffix for PJ flic files from ".FLI" to ".FLC"
	o - In player keywords "loadfli" and "freefli" changed to 
		"loadflic" and "freeflic"
	o - Tween/Inside-out works with closed shapes.
	o - True-color files with less than 256 colors don't hang convert.

Jim - (Code released to Build group as PJ60)
    o - Pan button uses click/click (as opposed to drag) protocol when
        moving fli larger than screen.
    o - Got rid of EXXX part of error messages.
    o - Poco error messages can be 5 lines long (instead of 1 line)
    o - <backspace> key equivalent to undo works in tween now.
    o - "Cancel" from file requestor retains path/file name next time
        you go to file requestor.
    o - Critical errors (disk write protected, drive not ready) are
        reported specifically rather than lumped under "critical error".
	o - Installed Ian's slight improvement to color map generation of
		true-color files in convert.   Noted that this will hang when
		true-color file contains less than 256 colors to begin with.
		(Ian'll fix this by next build no doubt.)

Peter -
    o - Fixed bug that made swap buffer (and others) get lost during
        engrave and other operations.

Ian - (Actually these changes were in PJ59,  but Jim forgot to include
      them in this doc file.)
This section is our response to the Poco bug list we got via Cindy from
???.   The ### comments are Jim's (before sent to Ian), and the >>> and !!!
ones are Ian's (after his fixes.)

ErrCode     Undefined in the header files.
        ### NAB (Not a bug.  Well, not worth fixing anyways....)
        >>> NAB
        !!! 'ErrCode' is a builtin type like Screen and Rast, it won't show up
            in a header anywhere.  'Errcode' is also builtin, since I got sick
            of getting whined at for not uppercasing the c, and it makes
            poe<->poc ports a little easier.


printf      if the length of the text to be printed is more
            than a line, "Abnormal Program Termination" occurs.
        >>> Fixed.
        !!! Page fault was being caused by overflowing an 80-byte
            buffer in toptext.c.  Now, the printf() glue checks to make sure
            the expanded string is < 80 chars.


Qbusy       The box disappears before the execution of the next
            program line; it does not wait for an input from
            the user.
        ### Let's get rid of Qbusy and unQbusy
        >>> Done.


Qtext       Right or left click anywhere on the screen resumes
            the program (instead of a click only on "continue"
            button).
            When the text is long (e.g. more than the size of
            the screen), "continue" button disappears.
        ### NAB
        >>> NAB
        !!! Okay, I guess.  Couldn't recreate the disappearing button
            bug, anyway.

Qchoice     When the length of all the buttons is more than
            a line, "Abnormal Program Termination" occurs
            (Attached: Qchoice.poc).
            When the text is long (e.g. more than the size of
            the screen),  buttons disappear.
            (Attached: Qchoice1.poc).
        >>> Partial fix.
        !!! I couldn't get a program crash when the length of all the
            buttons is bigger than the screen, but it does glitch the
            screen quite nicely, drawing outside of the box.  The strange
            thing is, it is the text that glitches, not the buttons.  I
            also couldn't get a glitch with a real long text string when
            the buttons were normal/legal; it wordwraps properly.  On the
            other hand, there was a bug with the buttons:  the glue in
            pocouser.c checked for a max of 8 buttons, but the routines in
            wndo\textbox.c could only handle 5. Now the glue uses the pre-
            defined symbol TBOX_MAXCHOICE (or whatever) so they're in sync.


Qstring     The length of the input box is shorter, i.e. the
            last character input does not apppear in the box.
            (Attached: Qstring.poc).
            When the text is long (e.g. more than the size of
            the screen),  button disappears.
            "string" gets assigned although user cancels.
        >>> Fixed.
        !!! Peter fixed this with his QSTRING.C change.  I had no problem with
            long text. String will get assigned even on a cancel; let's call
            it a feature!


Qmenu       When the number of choices is more than the number
            of elements in the array, either "Abnormal Program
            Termination" occurs, or garbage apppears for the
            missing array elements.
            (Attached: Qmenu.poc)
        >>> Fixed.
        !!! Added error checking to ensure the number of pointers passed
            jives with the count value passed.


Qnumber     No error message is given if min > max.
            The slider bar always appears wit min = 0; the
            min is set to the input value only if the user
            clicks on the arrows or the slider bar.
            (Attached: Qnumber.poc)
            While the user selects a number by typing in
            the box under the slider, the function does not
            check if this number is between min and max, and
            returns it.
        >>> Fixed.
        !!! The function is documented to allow out-of-range type-in
            numbers.  Added a plethora of numeric range checks on parms, to
            check for min > max and other silly things.


Qlist       When the header is long, its beginning and end are cut.  The
            cursor (vertical line) in the "selected item" box appears on the
            item if the item fills the box entirely.  This box can be made
            longer to have the cursor appear after the item.  (Attached:
            Qlist.poc, in case of "seven")
        >>> Fixed.
        !!! The stuff listed above is NAB, but...  The return value can be -1
            if the user types in something not in the list; this isn't doc'd.
            (I'll update that in the docs).  I quite agree with the lack of
            prettiness in the cursor, but this seems to occur throughout the
            string inputs in PJ, so at least it's consistently ugly.


Qfile       When the header is long, its beginning and end are cut.  It
            does not give an error message when a button other than
            "load", "save", etc. is passed.  It does not give a "File not
            found" message when a "load", "save", etc. operation is
            selected on a nonexisting file.  It does not "load" a .poc
            file although it exists.  When "button" is long in length, it
            overwrites "+".  It does not check if the suffix begins with a
            period or not and accepts the ones without it.
            (Attached: Qfile.poc)
        >>> Fixed.
        !!! (NAB)  Most of what's listed above seems to be somebody
            misinterpeting the docs or something; it mostly seems like
            reasonable behavior to me.  Just for grins, added some code to
            the glue routine to supply reasonable defaults for any parm
            which is passed as NULL or has a string length of zero. Also, it
            now makes sure at least the first suffix has a dot on it, but you
            can still screw up the other two, if you even realize that you're
            allowed to pass 3 at once (it's not doc'd that way).


WaitClick   A right-click returns 2, not 1 (in the POCO
            document it is 1).
        ### Fix this if you like.   Not a biggie.
        >>> NAB
        !!! The docs have apparently been fixed.


PollInput   A right-click returns 2, not 1. No code (0) is
            returned when a key is pressed.  After the user clicks on the
            "continue" in a "Qtext" box, PollInput returns 0 for both right
            and left.  (Attached:  PollInpu.poc)
        >>> NAB
        !!! The pollinput-after-qtext is probably a misperception based on
            the fact that a left-click causes the continue box to disappear
            immediately but doesn't return until button-up (meaning a
            pollinput right after a qtext is gonna show 0 for buttons),
            whereas a right-click causes the continue box to disappear and
            returns without waiting for button-up, so pollinput right
            afterwards shows a 2 for rightbutton.  Inconsistant, but
            harmless.  Oh, and the docs have apparently been fixed about
            the rightbutton = 2 stuff.  I had no problem with the key
            values; I suspect the tester didn't understand the way IBM
            combines scan code and ascii value.


WaitInput   A right-click returns 2, not 1.
        >>> NAB.
        !!! Looks like the docs have been fixed.


SetAbortHandler
SetAbort    These don't work. (I added these -- Ian).
        >>> Fixed.
        !!! Apparently, some changes I did to qpoco.c long ago got lost.
            Thus, all the abort checking and abort handler invocation code
            in pocouser.c was not getting used.


/************** Graphics Library ******************/

It is possible to set colors and RGB to values < 0 and > 255.

        >>> Fixed.
        !!! In all but one case, the values are adjusted via value&0xff.
            The missing one was the color index for SetColorMap; it's now
            adjusted too.


/************** Graphics Modes Library ***********/

GetBrushSize    Returns a number which is one less than
                the  actual size.
        ### This is ok.   We start with 0 in C is all....
        >>> Fixed.
        !!! I've made a note to update the docs for this.


SetMaskCreate   "Create" can be turned on at the same time with
                "Use" - SetMaskUse (this is not allowed in PJ).
        >>> Fixed.
        !!! Logic now included in glue routines so that if MaskUse(TRUE) is
            called, it will force vs.mask_make to FALSE, and if
            MaskCreate(TRUE) is called, it will force vs.mask_use to FALSE.
            This seems consistant with the menu handling code in qmask.c.


Set and GetStarRatio do not apply to rpoly (Poco manual bug).
        >>> Fixed.
        !!! Docs have apparently been updated.


SetSplineTCB    Sets the value of T to C and B (in TOOLS BOX for
                spline).
                (Attached: SetSplin.poc)
        >>> Fixed.
        !!! Ooops.  Bit of a typo in the glue routine.

GetSplineTCB    Returns C = B = 0 always.
                (Attached: SetSplin.poc)
        >>> Fixed.
        !!! Ooops again.  Parms in glue were defined as int * instead of Popot.


/************** Time Oriented Function Library **************/

GetFrame        Returns a frame number which is one less than
                the  actual frame number.
        >>> Fixed.
        !!! Docs have apparently been update to show that first frame is #0.


SetFrameCount   count = negative number causes "Abnormal Program
                Termination: Memory Protection Fault".
                count = 0 causes "Abnormal Program Termination:
                Divide Overflow".
        >>> Fixed.
        !!! Rerouted routine from direct call to set_flx_length() to a new
            glue routine that checks the frame count and returns an error
            when the count is <= 0.


PlayFlic        When a negative number is passed, it plays the
                animation over and over, i.e. in an infinite
                loop.
        >>> Fixed.
        !!! Docs have apparently updated to make this a feature.


SetSpeed        does not set the speed correctly. For example,
                SetSpeed(14) sets it to 1,
                SetSpeed(71) sets it to 5, etc.
        ### NAB.   Internally the speed is in microseconds for this
            function.
        >>> Fixed.
        !!! Docs have apparently been updated.


GetSpeed        does not get the speed correctly - gives a value
                which is approximately 14 times the actual speed.
        >>> Fixed.
        !!! NAB.  Docs now reflect that time is 1000ths, not jiffies.


InsertFrames    "Abnormal Program Termination" occurs for negative
                inputs.
        >>> Fixed.
        !!! Added a check to the glue routine to ensure parm is > 0.


DeleteFrames    When a count > total frame number, or count < 0
                is passed, it does not delete the last frame
                (deletes others).
        >>> NOT FIXED!
        !!! This looks complicated; there is no glue routine and I'm not sure
            enough about the desired behavior to build one to check the parm.



/*************** Cel Library **************************/

CelGetFrame     Returns a frame number which is one less than
                the  actual frame number.
        >>> Fixed.
        !!! Docs have been updated to reflect first cel == 0.



/*************** Screen Library ******************/

GetPixel        does not return the correct color.
                (Attached: GetPixel.poc)
        >>> Fixed.
        !!! Typo in glue function (declaration included color, it shouldn't).


GetBlock        While allocating memory for the block, it does not
                take the absolute value of width and height, i.e.
                if width or height is negative, it gives
                "not enough memory message".
        >>> Fixed.
        !!! Added check for negative width or height to glue routine; now
            returns Err_parameter_range if either is negative.


SetBlock        Same as GetBlock.
        >>> Fixed.
        !!! Same.



/*************** Optics Library **********************/

        >>> NOT FIXED!
        !!! For all of these:  I'm leaving the fix to someone else; I don't
            understand optics well enough to even attempt it.

OptSetPos       When the denominator q (of the scale factor in
                optPos) is set to 0, "Abnormal Program
                Termination: Divide Overflow" occurs.


OptToFrame      No error message is given when t < 0 or t > 1.


OptToSegment    Renders all of the transformation, i.e.
                not only the transformation between start
                and stop.




/*************** Misc. Functions Library ***************/

ResizeReset     Does not give an error message for inputs <= 0.
        >>> Fixed.
        !!! Added a glue routine to check for inputs <= 0 or > SHRT_MAX,
            since the real routine (reset_default_flx) takes short parms.
            (Actually, I don't think this ever worked right, since without
            a glue routine it used to pass a pair of INTs to a PJ routine
            that expects a pair of SHORTs.)


rnd             does not give an error message and returns an
                integer out of range if max < 0.
        >>> Fixed.
        !!! Now returns Err_parameter_range for max < 0.


/*************** Animator File Library  ***************/

        >>> NOT FIXED!
        !!! The glue routines for these look fine; might be a usuage error
            or a problem in the low level routines.

LoadMask        Does not load, gives an E1 error.
                (Attached: LoadMask.poc, mask.msk)

SaveMask        Does not save.




/*************** Text Library **********************/


WordWrap        When width and/or height is negative, x and y
                are no longer the upper left coordinates of
                the box. Since the text starts from (x, y),
                it does not appear in the box in such a case.
            >>> NAB?
            !!! Is this a bug?  Sounds like it's working the only way it can.


GetFontDir      Returns blank.
            >>> NOT FIXED!
            !!! Glue routine looks fine.


/********************************************************/




P.S.    I couldn't test DirList, LoadPoe, and RunPoe because
    I don't have enough documentation on these functions,
    and I couldn't create a test case for IconBlit.
    Also I was not able to test OptSetState, and OptGetState
    because the interpreter gave a "not enough buffer"
    message for the following:

    OptState os;
    ..
    OptSetState(&os);

BUG FIXES
    o - Color map is loaded from setting files correctly (and default.flx).
    o - Fixed short scroller in browse menu in hi res.
    o - Fixed bug that made mask contents shift sometimes.

Peter (Code in Jim's hand Feb 17, 1991)
BUG FIXES
    o - Scroller for input device drivers and poco scroller would truncate
        full length names by one character. Fixed.
    o - #30619 NAB source and dest are not states of the zoom but tools 
        to create it and are only "active" when they are in use. When they are
        in use the little menu is not visible. Fullsize only sets the zoom to
        the fullsize state. The others are used to do other sizes.  No record
        is kept of the previous soom setting so using the fullsize button to 
        "undo" back to the previous isn't available.
    o - #33507 Fixed.
    o - #30641 Fixed.  Upper case switched to lower.
    o - #30447 brush menu added to streak tool.
    o - #32646 Fixed. characters ."/[]|<>+= and , are now rejected as temp path
        characters.
    o - #32640 Fixed. Floppy drives no longer allowed for temp drives.
        Also startup handles temp drive errors correctly.
    o - #32639 The docs were written to match the program.  The program
        hasn't changed.  If we should change the name let us know.
    o - #33529 Fixed. Palette now inaccessable from sprite.
    o - #30643 NAB. Only by explicitly loading the colors in the menu colors
        option can you do this. Sorry.
    o - #30450 In fact this was changed because it was more confusing having it
        act differently on the palette menu than on the home menu.
        You will note the RGB HLS toggle is now the same way. to be consistent.
    o - #30448 Fixed.
    o - #32206 Hopefully fixed.  Maintainence of these colors will not be
        exact in a compromise is made if a visible color set can be achieved
        that is reasonable close.
    o - #32200 NAB How the cluster is created (ie: what is actually in it) 
        should be known.  If one has 25 instances of the same color that is 
        FUNCTIONALLY different than one instance. 25 instances will give 25 
        dots, one on each instance,  One instance = one dot. What is present
        will effect operations like cycle draw, vgad, hgrad and the like and it 
        should be known by the user.
    o - #30651 All known ones are fixed.
    o - #30434 Fixed.
    o - #32649 Fixed.
    o - #33519 Fixed.
    o - #30439 No bug listing for this entry.
    o - #32627 Feature changed.
    o - #32644 Fixed.
    o - #32622 Fixed. Making exactly 4000 frames corrupted memory.
    o - #32620 Fixed. Making exactly 4000 frames corrupted memory.
    o - #32217 You will find that all tabular listings are off. especially the
        driver selector menus. This is a problem with proportional fonts
        where the characters are of different widths.
    o - #32625 Added message.
    o - #32612 Withought room to put a whole word 1 and 2 is as good as
        any at least first and second has an order which is implicit. The one
        you load second as you enter join is the second fli.
        R and I have no meaning unless one has read the manual to have
        fore knowledge of what the designer was thinking.
    o - #80838 Fixed.
    o - #30660 Unable to duplicate, I got 117 for 4 trys. When I recorded it 
        as a macro It always worked.  I found performing this sequence pretty
        tedious. There is a strange anomaly that would cause some weirdness 
        dependent on what the previous operation was and it might be corrected.
        My basic thought on spark ink is, What you see is what you get. 
    o - Aborting a rendering polygon now doesn't draw edge line after abort
        but aborts pronto.
    o - #30659 Fixed. cel tile ink dither now works.
    o - #30658 NAB Merge ink is the same as scrape ink except that it shows
        the alt screen through the main screen as if the main screen had
        a transparencey. The higher the strength the more the alt screen
        shows through. It is like pasting a cel with glass ink.
    o - #30657 NAB see #30656
    o - #30656 NAB I'm afraid we only have 256 colors to choose from all of
        the transparent ink types calculate what color they "want" to be and 
        then look for the "closest" color in the palette to what is desired.
        in some cases the closest one is the color being drawn upon. Sorry
        it's not a true color system.
    o - Expand operation now aborts in a more timely manner when requested.
    o - Removed double error report from loading a fli if the file is not found.
    o - #32222 Nab. This ink works as designed for the intended purpose.
        The help text has been clarified and updated.
close_help "Close single pixel gaps in boundary lines of current color.  "
           "Designed as an aid in creating fillable boundary shapes."
    o - #32635 Fixed.
    o - #32650 Fixed.
    o - #33514 ??? It should be on when grid is off and be separately
        toggled. If anything the "grid" toggle should be turned off when 
        angle snap is active. since the two conflict and don't give a reasonable
        result together on cel rotation operations.  It should be added to 
        optics if we have time. To make angle snap what it should be would 
        require some major changes to the interface and some internal math
        and it is too late now.  This feature was sort of 'hung' on.
    o - #33533 Fixed with #33400
    o - #33401 Nab. This is true, the backwards function could be eliminated
        since you could save a 'whole' segment backwards.  It is left in for
        coherance with the animator 1.0 The backwards item only saves the 
        whole thing backwards. Save segment is an enhancement.
    o - #33400 Fixed. Making exactly 4000 frames corrupted memory.
        doesn't any more.
    o - #32636 Nab Nab. A lot of work wnt in to that. if the segment is
        reversed over time operations happen in the direction of the
        segment.
    o - #30622 Fixed display and hit protocall cleaned up.
    o - Font loading if it cant find the font under the font path sets the
        name to the "=Ram6by6" name appended to the current font drawer so
        the font will be found.  Rather than "system.fnt" which is a file
        and may not be in the current font drawer. This only happens if the
        font is deleted when pj is down or there is a fatal error re-loading
        the font. This guarantees a font. We could change this to the sail
        font if desired since poco drags it in anyway. I don't want to change
        the drawer so the font requestor will get its list from the same place.
FEATURES CHANGES
    o - Expand 2x function now brings up a marquee box in the same manner as
        paste cel before executing.  The position of this box has been
        added to the setings file.
    o - Frame count is now loaded from default settings file when doing
        a reset. This will create the default fli with the framcount that was
        saved when the default.set was saved.
    o - Cleaned up stderr text"boxes" so they look better.
    o - Cleaned up made coherent and added input command line arguments 
        for pj,player, and convert.

INTERNAL CHANGES:
    o - Installed code to allow softmenu text for video driver info texts.
        This is optional in the driver.  I put texts for 8514A and Vram in the
        aa.mu file.  Drivers are identical with previous drivers.  Key system 
        is compatable with existing spec.
    o - Installed host side code for picdriver info text to be softmenuable.
    o - Installed host side code for picdriver options qchoice text to be
        softmenuized.
    o - Installed keys and softmenu texts in aa.mu for targa.pdr and tiff.pdr.

02-11-91 10:01:19 Ian Code integrated.

    o - Big changes to converter and tiff.pdr and targa.pdr bug fixes etc.

FEATURES CHANGES

    o - Paths are now included in the default.set file.
    o - Version number on settings chunk in fli changed.  Simply you can't load 
        settings from old flis the rest of the file is unchanged.
    o - Version number on settings files changed.
    o - Old default.fli files are now unusable to load settings from due to 
        version change.
    o - A couple of changes to make the paths /settings thing a little more 
        coherant and servicable and a result of untangling the mess that 
        needed to be undone all along.

            There is a new file in the \paat directory. A temp file that is 
        destroyed if one does an abandon.  "AATEMP.SET" This is the settings 
        for the current environment.  It contains the paths that were in the 
        config file and all the settings that were in the aatemp.flx  The 
        config file now has no paths in it. Only the setting for the temorary
        drive path. And the aatemp.flx has no settings in it.  Since the 
        tempflx is loaded into ram this saves memory.

            The aatemp.set is a settings file like the ones you save out when
        you do a save settings. EXACTLY the same. Save will actually copy this
        file to where you're saving it.

            default.fli will revert to it's previous name DEFAULT.SET it is 
        now also a settings file EXACTLY like any other settings file with the
        exception of having added palette data for the default fli.  It 
        remains saved and loaded in the directory that pj is executed from.

            The menu colors are still stored in the config file AND the default
        settings file.  One main reason to have the menu colors in the config 
        file is that this file is shared between the converter, player and 
        pj.  Since these other programs don't have access to the settings 
        file they need the  colors in the config file.  It also prevents your
        colors from being wiped out with a flic reset. The other programs also
        need access to the mouse driver settings and screen driver settings.  
        The aa.cfg file path remains the directory the programs are executed
        from and they will create it if it is not present.

02-06-91 12:00:12 Peter released pj58 to build group
BUG FIXES:
    o - #30644 Unable to reproduce on pj57 I believe it was before the 
        final version of the cursor file was frozen.
    o - #32215 Partial change to feature.  Paths now have names truncated,
        when doing an abandon.  You are right they do not "reset" when one
        does a flic-reset this is by design. I am sending a memo on this 
        subject.
    o - #33508 Fixed.
    o - #32223 Fixed.
    o - #30648 I believe someone is trying to save a cursor from the cel menu.
        Cursors although they can be loaded as cels or flis or pics are cursors
        and MUST be saved with the save cursor option which promps you for the
        hot spot and saves it out as a specialized cursor file.  Saving it
        from the cel menu will save a CEL file. A .CUR on the cel menu would
        make saving a cursor seem available.  This feature is somewhat 
        hidden since few want to be bothered with it in normal use of pj.
    o - #33516 Fixed
    o - #80836 NAB This was a design decision since many people have text files
        without .txt on them and also want to save them without suffi. Ascii
        files are super generic.  If the extention is forced it makes it 
        impossible to save the name you want in many cases.
    o - #33404 Fixed.
    o - #33403 Fixed. Load_fli() now returns Err_no_file when the file
        or directory is missing, instead of Err_not_found. 
        A filename can not be mispelled in the browse menu since there is 
        no field where you can enter the name.
    o - #33402 This is a design issue. In many cases the info is good to have
        when reporting problems especially since the text is in a volitile
        file and can be changed.  If a customer has a problem it helps to
        know the code. It also differentiates an error from a general
        message.
    o - #32218 NAB  If you want to erase the numbers you need to use the 
        unblue frame operation.  This works as designed.
    o - #30649 NAB The cursor system we use always undraws the cursor when
        the screen is being drawn on. Otherwise the cursor could corrupt the
        screen.  Not as sophisticated as computers with true sprite HARDWARE
        but it works. This is a pc and not a MacII or an Amiga.
    o - #30646 NAB This is wron in the manual.  The Hand.cur is the cursor used
        when it is used for pan mode which is also active when the zoom menu
        is up. (you can pan the windows in the zoom menu mode)
    o - #30645 Fixed.
    o - #30662 This is a charactaristic of the display hardware/monitor
        combination and is beyond pj's control.
    o - #32645 Fixed.
    o - #32603 NAB.  This a characteristic of the hardware. Or specificly
        the relationship between the hardware used (or virtual settings used) 
        in 3d studio and the vga card in your machine.  It is not the pixel
        dimentions of a picture that determine proportion but how they are
        displayed.
    o - #30435 Fixed.
    o - #32633 Fixed.
    o - #32615 All dos messages need fixing. Not passed up from dos call.
    o - #32614 Fixed. Browse now displays whole suffix in all cases.
        Since the browse menu now displays flis AND cels the extention is of
        importance.
    o - #33530 NAB This is one reason there is the move to cursor option.
    o - #33526 Fixed. Ambiguous text. I assume it means cel was not pasted
        but, WAS incremented.
    o - #33525 Fixed.
    o - #33524 Fixed. Palette menu no longer accessable through sprite panel.
    o - #33523 Undo button removed from sprite panel.
    o - #33522 Fixed. Palette menu no longer accessable through sprite panel.
    o - #33521 Fixed.
    o - #33504 NAB Buffers are allocated for the cel sprite operation
        dependent on the size of the items used. Stretching the cel will
        tax the memory available.
    o - #33504 Inks button now NOT disabled.  Sprite pen tool not available
        and cel de-highlighted in inks menu.
    o - #30453 Done.
    o - #33518 NAB The fill fli both stretches the cel to fit and centers it.
        Unstretch simply unstretches it and doesn't restore position. Use
        Undo to restore it to what it was.
UNREPORTED BUG FIXES:
    o - Corrected bug in current_device() to remove device delimiter from
        device name returned. Callers were expecting device name only.
    o - Installed missing screen overlay undraw-redraw on flip5 and flip
        segment operations.
    o - Added recursion checks for several menus where they were missing.
    o - Disabled the big palette menu for access through sprite menu.
        The little square color picker is still active.
    o - Undo button removed from sprite menu.
    o - Bug in load settings fixed where menu colors were set to default.
        They are now set to the colors saved in the settings or fli file.
        Note that the menu colors are not altered by a flic-reset but must be
        explicitly loaded via load-settings.  One can load settings from the
        default.fli file if want wants to get the colors saved.
        We can remove the "feature" of loading the colors from a settings file
        if it is not desired very simply.
    o - Redo for editable items now sends you into edit mode first. Then if
        the "T" is on it sends you into the time menu, or pastes the item
        on the current screen if the "T" is off.  The time menu will paste the
        item on the segment selected.
    o - Cursor keys for seeking in and playing fli now work when cel menu 
        and tween menus are hidden.
    o - 'z' key now works in tween, and animcel, for toggling zoom while 
        menus are hidden.
    o - '@' key now works in optics, tween, animcel, tools, and inks 
        for bringing up the palette menu.
    o - '?' key now works in optics, tween, animcel, tools, and inks 
        for bringing up the status box.
    o - Zoom disabled on menus reached through Optics.
INTERNAL CHANGES:
    o - Put all option tool names in aa.mu
    o - Added smu_name_scatters() to load lots of strings from a list of names
        and pointers from a namestring list.
    o - Set up mechanism to allow 3rd party rex libraries like inks to 
        operate and use imbedded Texts and not require use of the softmenu 
        by having an escape code on the string that defines whether the string
        is a key or text. Only autodesk managed code should use keys.
    o - Softmenuized all ink names.
    o - renamed \paa\rexlib\loader\  \paa\rexlib\rexhost\
    o - Softmenuized all tool help texts.
    o - The top name for the inks option scroller and tools option scroller
        are now separate in the vsettings.
    o - Added directory \paa\rexlib\inklib and code to build library
        \paa\rexlib\aainklib.lib for linking with inks.
    o - added file aainklib.h in \paa\inc and aainklib.c(obj) in \paa
        to support loadable inks.
    o - Divided up memory functions in \paa\util for cleaner linking.
    o - Updated fli library for changes to code since 3dstudio version.
        Ran some tests.
    o - Disabled user zoom toggle when system zoom is disabled, set button
        to reflect disable state.
FEATURES CHANGES:
    o - The f10 key function for saving the screen snapshot now comes up with
        a 3 way requestor asking to overwrite the old file, increment the name
        or to cancel if the file exists.  It also saves the last saved path.
    o - Red 'X's are now put in the last 5 palette menu colors if the hardware 
        colors for these have been taken over for the menus.
1/24/91 Peter - released to build group as PJ57
INTERNAL CHANGES:
    o - Added a directory off of \ root called \build that contains all
        executables needed to produce pj release from the source in \paa.
    o - Modified makefiles, backup utilities and other batch files to
        handle the new \build directory. Added the -build option to backup.bat
    o - Changed master make file to have a "release" option to build all of
        pj and create a release directory with pj executables and other
        necessary code to make a testing release floppy.
BUG FIXES:
    o - Tween polys are now refreshed whenever the colors are changed on the
        mini palette (Jack bug).
    o - Menu colors hardware cmap management now fixed for loading new menu
        colors. (Jack bug).
    o - Changed qget_changes() to save temp cel file AFTER changes are filtered
        out.  This to correct loss of changes in some circumstances (Jack bug).
    o - Sep tool and "picture/separate" now aborts correctly.
    o - Player file requestor now displays "Load" or "Open" in button
        depending whether it was brought up using the load or open pull option.
1/16/91 Jim 
BUG FIXES:
    o - Digifont produced HPJET fonts seem to work now.  
        (They include a copyright notice in a place where the old reader
        expected character data.  Also they don't have data for the
        space character.   I worked around these,  but wish I had
        a better font spec.)

1/15/91 Jim - released to build group as PJ56
BUG FIXES:
    o - Error messages for when there's not enough memory for loading
        a flic are fixed.
    o - #30829 NAB.  If you try tweening between two shapes with 
        relatively few points you'll see that the 'splining' happens
        throughout.   If you go from a shape with few points (the rpoly)
        to a shape with many points (the petal) indeed it will appear
        that only the first frame is splined.  What actually happens is 
        this: the first frame of the tween generates a polygon that is
        identical to first polygon (the rpoly).  Specifically it will
        only have 6 points.   Subsequent frames will have many many points,
        and so the spline will be between short line segments, and so not
        appear to curve much.    This is an algorithmic limitation
        which I'd prefer to live with than the alternative (end shapes
        not quite being exactly the same as what you've drawn in a tween.)
    o - #30830 Fixed.  (Or at least better.   When we made RGB colors go from
        0-255 instead of 0-63 we introduced a bug in the menu color
        finding code that Peter spotted and fixed the other day.)
    o - #80833 Fixed.  Open shapes tween much better.   Root of the problem
        was neglecting to scale the last point with the rest in this case.
    o - #80839 Fixed.  tween/end-to-start's effect is apparent immediately.
    o - #30441 fixed.  (Actually fixed a couple of revs ago.)  Can cancel out
        of tween/star,rpoly, etc.)
    o - #30442 fixed.  Tween shape menu is alphabetized.  (Also a fix from
        a few revs back really.)
    o - #30446 fixed.  Tween-shape/reverse renamed to Inside Out.

1/14/91 Peter Uploaded to Jim Jan 14 11:30 
BUG FIXES:
    o - Join "Key Mask" now loads .MSK files as well as flis and pdr pics 
        although performance is slow on startup when using slow loading pic 
        types like .GIF.
    o - Right click on key mask button in join will now bring up mask file
        requestor as well as right click on mask file name label.
INTERNAL CHANGES:
    o - Commented out some un-needed debugging code in util\memalloc.c
    o - Staticly set mem_free values to a large value to make init_mem() 
        optional in the cutil.lib so page faults can be more accurate in 
        torture and stepper.
    o - Fixed up stepper and got it to link.


1/12/91 Jim (Sources released as PJ55 to Build Group and Ian.)
INTERNAL CHANGES:
    o - While integrating Ian's new driver testing code ifdef'ed out some
        debugging code in util\memalloc.c that was causing link problems
        (a yes_no_box in check_mem_list()).   This should speed up PJ's
        memory allocation a bit as a side effect.

1/11/91 Jim (Exe's released as PJ54 to Cindy, Bob, Jack.)
BUG FIXES:
    o - #32624 Fixed. Redo over time works.  The bug was that the time-select
        menu was disabling redo.   It did this in case they went to 
        the ink menu from there at which point redo _shouldn't_ be active.
        (We don't want them drawing underneath the time-select.)  Fix
        made time-select disable redo just before calling ink menu.
    o - #30616 Fixed.  Actually fixed glass dither and other dithers too.
    o - #80842 Fixed.  (Routine was getting negative input but thought it
        was a huge number.)
    o - #80842 Fixed.  Grey out save button if temporary text file doesn't 
        exist.
    o - #31200 Fixed.  Redo with text tool just draws text without placing
        you in the editor.
    o - A similar bug where redo poly would take you into something to
        move around points in the polygon before pasting it now just
        pastes the poly.
    o - #32210, 32211, 32211, 32212, & 32213 fixed.  (A routine in fli.c
        hadn't been updated when we switched the fli-speed internally from
        jiffies to milliseconds.)
    o - #30825 fixed.  Tween trail option greyed out when no tween.
    o - #30826 fixed.  0 radius scaling circle doesn't crash size-tween.

1/11/91 Peter
BUG FIXES:
    o - #32626 Edge tool Fixed.
    o - #32626 Soften ink Fixed. and speed tweaked with new soft_hline();
    o - #32626 Spark ink Fixed. and speed tweaked with new cry_hline();
    o - #32621 Fixed.
    o - #32607 Fixed (changed).  The mask is first displayed in a two color
        format. A pen click will toggle the mask between the two color format 
        and a format with the mask colored and the picture behind it showing
        through where the mask is 0.  A right click or any key will exit mask
        viewing.
    o - #32632 Fixed.
    o - #30637 Fixed.
    o - #33500 NAB We decided that most of the time one does a reset of the 
        flic one wants to maintain the menu color setting.  One can reset the 
        colors in the palette menu.
    o - #30444 NAB The internal representation of the angle inherited from
         animator 1.0 is such that any display of the angle would be 
         frustratingly inaccurate.  It would actually be impossible to 
         rotate a cel by 11.25 degrees since the integer representation
         couldn't contain it.  This is a definate fault, but
         would require some massive changes to correct. The same is true of
         angles in the optics system.
    o - #32615 Fixed.
    o - #32208 Fixed.
    o - #32626 Fixed.
    o - #32625 Fixed.
    o - #33501 NAB. For efficient memory and temp file usage when the first 
        frame of a cel is clipped by whatever means, the old cel is trashed.
        The old cel is preserved if the scan for the cel bounds is aborted 
        before the clipping actually starts (when the outline is shown).
INTERNAL CHANGES:
    o - Moved function void stuff_cmap(Cmap *cmap, Rgb3 *color);
        from player to gfx.lib
    o - Truncated aa.doc from pj47 on down and put it in aaold.doc
        put a second grep in the cb.bat for finding fixed bugs. Vastly speeds
        up the doc edits.
    o - Modified rastlib\makefile  util\makefile and fileio\makefile 
        to eliminate files *.lbc.  These files are now transient temp 
        files during the make and are no longer part of the archive.
    o - Added smuvqren.obj and smuqrecn.obj to pjhigh to reduce redundancy and
        un-needed code linking with player and converter.

BUG FIXES:
    o - #33501 NAB.   
    o - #32605 Fixed.
    o - #32602 Fixed.
    o - #30638 NAB.   You can load a .cur file as a cel, but they aren't
        the same thing.  When you select cel/file/save it will be
        saving a cel.   So renaming the suffix to .cel is appropriate.
        (That it keeps the same wildcard you set last time you were
        getting a listing of cel files may be confusing in this case,
        but it's generally a nice capability.)
    o - #30639 NAB.  This is a frill for the wishlist at best.
    o - #80837 Fixed.  We use menu font for blue numbers.
    o - #30621 NAB.  In a bigger world it would be nice to have
        a close (nesting) icon on the frames menu.  In our little
        bitty 320x200 world there is no room.
    o - 32611 NAB.  There is not much room for meaningful words
        in place of "ANI" in the top pull-down.   I'm inclined to
        use the name of the executable program here.  I would
        like this name to be ANI, but we'll have to see what
        Bob and Joel and Barry decide....
    o - 32623 NAB.  Redo is used in several other application to
        mean what we mean by it.  Specifically the first paint program
        I saw with this capability - DigiPaint on the Amiga - used
        "Redo".   Redo also has the advantage of being smaller, a real
        consideration in the home panel!
    o - 32612 NAB.  Somehow remembering I: and R: seems even harder
        (and equally arbitrary) than 1: and 2:.
    o - 32622 - fixed.
    o - 32208 fixed
    o - 32615 fixed


1/07/90 Jim
BUG FIXES:
    o - Error message when driver can't open screen/find hardware is more
        sensible.
    o - Poco/Use  has a path independent of Poco/Program,  which reduces
        the likelihood of overwriting a program you're using.

1/07/90 Peter
BUG FIXES:
    o - Fixed bug in get_full_path() that would not properly expand some 
        partial paths.
INTERNAL CHANGES:
    o - Speed tweaked paste grid and fixed a bug where it wouldn't abort 
        correctly in over time operations.
NEW FEATURES:
    o - Put in video driver spec as startup command line argument in player.
    o - Added loadfli command to player to load flis into ram so they play
        faster.  Optimized loading only loads some frames if it's fast enough
        to do of disk. See player.doc
    o - Scripts in player are now syntax checked before execution starts
        during a scan for loaded flis. Flis are checked for existence and file 
        type on this first pass. pictures are only verified when actually
        loaded. Scripts linked to are checked for existence but not syntax.
        Called scripts are considered part of the root script and are scanned
        for syntax along with the root script.

1/3/91 Jim  (Released as PJ53 to Ian)
INTERNAL CHANGES:
    o - Recompiled the world using the -otx optimization which
        Ian's found to be better for both space and time.
    o - noted \paa\rastlib\clipsafe.asm is missing.  Copied from \opaa.
    o - changed torture.exp (the display driver tester) to link
        directly with PJ libraries instead of composed "fli.lib".
        Changed doslfile.lib  to  dosfile.lib  in the torture.lnk file.
NEW FEATURES:
    o - Convert has a flic/save-other option.
FEATURES CHANGES:
    o - Convert will load 8 bit color mapped Targa format files.
    o - Text editor will now warn you when the file is too big to edit.
BUG FIXES:
    o - Convert doesn't page fault when you cancel out of a save file
        requestor.
    o - I traced a wierd bug where sometimes the text cursor would disappear
        near the bottom of a file to the file having embedded zero characters.
        I'm not sure what causes this in the first place,  and have been
        unable to get the text editor to produce such files on its own
        However I now strip zeros out when reading in a file.

12/19/90 Jim (integrated with Peter.)
NEW FEATURES:
    o - Have a sld.pdr which will read AutoCAD slide files.
INTERNAL CHANGES:
    o - setwc386.bat sets a %pjmake% environment variable the make.bat
        files use to find the Turbo make.exe.  This is so the build
        group can use our make.bat files more easily in their environment.
    o - "make all" now builds the convert and player program too.
    o - "make release ##" is history.   Do "release ##" instead (and
        it's the build's group file to modify if need.)

12/14/90 ian (released back to Ian as PJ52)
BUG FIXES:
    o - Poco OverTime works again.
INTERNAL CHANGES:
    o - Poco calls to library routines seem simpler to the library routine.
        (Faster too.)  Instead of copying the first 24 or so bytes from
        the poco stack to the C stack,  the call-glue simply changes
        stacks.

12/19/90 pk
BUG FIXES:
    o - Swapped position of Ok and Cancel buttons on the driver menu.  This
        Effects all uses of this menu, Screen size and Pdr selection, in PJ
        the player and the converter. "Ok" on the left, "Cancel" on the right.
    o - #30636 Fixed.
    o - Removed non-functional "Load" button from the brush selector menu.
    o - #30437 Fixed.
    o - The path used for the fli to composite with the current fli is not
        saved to the fli path.  The path remains the path of the loaded fli.
    o - #32608 Fixed.
    o - #32208 Fixed again, slipped out of integration.
    o - #32207 Fixed.
    o - #80832 Fixed. Mask path now stored and if mask mode was last mode,
        The path is restored to the last used path.  If no mask is found for
        That path, Mask mode is canceld and cut mode is the default.
FEATURES CHANGES:
    o - Added gosub command to player script language.  Changed action of 
        escape key abort to better facilitate use of the keychoice menu 
        capability and gosubs with menus.  
        Future un-finished player features are:
            o - Scripted disable and enable of keyboard input monitored during
                the play of a fli, speed keys, escape abort, and control C
                script abort.
            o - A protocall for scripting the pre-load of flis into ram, and
                freeing flis from ram to facilitate faster playing.  For now
                all scripted flis play from disk. The code behind this feature 
                is mostly finished.
            o - A calldos(blah blah) command to execute a dos program from
                the script.
            I don't see any more additional features to the player script.

12/14/90 pk (This is PJ51)
BUG FIXES:
    o - #32209 Fixed.
    o - #32208 Fixed.
    o - #80844 Fixed. ( same as 32620 )
    o - #32620 Fixed. Missing return for function.
    o - #30837 Changed to use current menu font for blue numbers.
    o - #30611 feature changed.
    o - #32609 Fixed
    o - #32613 Fixed.
    o - #32614 Fixed.
    o - #32617 Fixed.
    o - #32618 Fixed.
    o - #32619 Fixed.
    o - #32604 Fixed.
    o - #32608 Fixed.
    o - #32616 Fixed.
    o - #32203 NAB Cycle draw uses the cluster colors which are cycled as the
        SOURCE colors for the operation. Glass and darken ink use the source 
        color and blend it with the color on the screen to produce the result-
        ing color actually drawn.  The color drawn to the screen most likely 
        will not be in the cluster the source colors are taken from.  When 
        the color map is cycled only those colors ON THE SCREEN which are in
        the cluster will be cycled.
FEATURES CHANGES:
    o - Browse now displays cels and flis.
    o - Added browse cels to cel pull down.
    o - Added a "postage stamp" control chunk to the first frame record
        of a fli or cel file to increase speed of the browse menu.  Compatible 
        with previous fli files. Only previous files may load into browse 
        slower.  Load and save a file to update file for this feature.
    o - Changes to player script language. Added -type play option and 
        removed callchoice and linkchoice and replaced them with keychoice.
    o - Changed "Frames" to "Cel Frames:" along side cel menu frame 
        seeking icon.
    o - Changed default cel move tool "to cursor" option to off.
    o - Changed player fadein fadeout color and time spec in script.
        Added link command to script.
    o - Changed fill_inkwell() to not set the ccolor to the minipalette
        cel altered.
INTERNAL CHANGES:
    o - renamed cline() to pj_cline() for fli library
    o - added pj_scale_blit() to raster calls in gfx library.

12/14/90 jk
INTERNAL CHANGES:
    o - Made soft_scatter softmenu routine - which takes a list of
        string addresses, and stuffs those addresses with a String
        type from aa.mu.   Then made the palette panel strings come
        from String palette_panel in aa.mu.   Also the tween panel.
    o - Made ink names and help come from aa.mu.
    o - All the strings in the font requestor now come from aa.mu.
    o - Moved aasyslib.c from pjhigh\ to fileio\ so the torture program
        could use it.

BUG FIXES:
    o - In convert 16 bit Targa files aren't yellow tinted.
    o - Improved the way HP fonts are handled.   They don't leave
        trails when moving around the text window.
    o - #30813 - Fixed. animcel options key equivalents - fixed for some time
        now actually.
    o - #32610 - Fixed. Mispelled Lasso
    o - #31201 - NAB.  Fonts themselves are bad - poor conversions of some
        Macintosh fonts.  You can adjust the spacing manually for decent
        results.
    o - #80836 - NAB.  You can edit any ascii file, not just those with
        .TXT suffixes.
    o - #38626 - NAB. No longer an issue with font requestor redesign.
        Fonts can have any suffix.
    o - #30626 - Fixed.  Your latest font selection shows up on the
        file requestor you get from a "Font Directory" pick on the
        font requestor.
    o - #30628 - Fixed.  Have "system.fnt" instead of "unnamed.fnt" on
        initial font file requestor.
    o - #30629 - Fixed.  "Load Font" is now "Fonts" on the font requestor
        title button.
    o - #30630 - Fixed.  Fonts has a nesting icon.
    o - #30631 - gone.  Should be fixed as a side effect of some other
        changes.
    o - #30632 - Fixed.  Values outside of the range of the slider when
        you set Leading are clipped to slider range.
    o - #30633 - Fixed.  Same thing for Spacing.
    o - #30634 - Wish list.   I'm afraid a lot of our buttons could
        use some more limitations on what input they allow.  (You can
        put letters in a number requestor!)  Now isn't really the time
        for it though.
    o - #80846 - Fixed.  Huge numbers not allowed for spacing/leading.
    o - #30635 - Wish List.   Values are harmlessly clipped.  Effect is
        immediately apparent to user.  I don't think an error message
        is necessary.
    o - #30433 - ????? - need font to reproduce this.  (Maybe it's in my
        public dir somewhere?
    o - #30624 - fixed - The + button on fonts file requestor has
        bettor error handling.
    o - #30625 - fixed - Invalid file names in fonts file requestor
        have better error handling.
    o - #80832 - NAB. Number to right of segment and fsa buttons by design
        always displays segment length.   (This is a change from Animator
        though.)
    o - #30438 - fixed.  Undo works right when adjusting RGB/HLS sliders.
    o - #80834 - fixed.  Trace/Insert Tween works.
    o - null.drv works better as a torture example.

FEATURES CHANGES:
    o - When a picture load fails partway through,  the partial
        load is left onscreen.   This is so that users can get at
        least the first part of a truncated picture.
    o - Resource has a font subdirectory.  The font requestor initially
        uses this as it's directory.
    o - Redid menu layout of font menu and simplified it a bit.   
        Eliminated the font type selection.  The program can figure
        out what type of font is selected without user prompting.

12/06/90 jk (Released as PJ50)
INTERNAL CHANGES:
    o - Made a new softmenu routine - stack_string - and replaced most
        hard coded strings involved with calls to the file requestor
        with stack_strings.
BUG FIXES:
    o - #30445 Reintegrated change to convert to get it to not have lots of
        unfreed memory chunks.
    o - You can cancel with a right click or keypress when creating a 
        regular poly, star, oval, or petal in tween.
    o - A couple of places where the undo buffer wasn't being properly
        maintained in the palette menu are gone.
    o - Trace/Insert Tween works.
    o - Menus redraw when palette is changed.
FEATURES CHANGES:
    o - A lot of the user interface text is capitalized differently
        as per Jack's suggestions.
    o - Tween shape menu alphabetised.
    o - Have a tiff-picture-driver that works with monochrome and
        greyscale TIFFs.
    o - 2-key pulldown equavalents that are not the same as the first
        letter of the word are now underlined (if they exist in the
        word at all....  The Poco ';' equivalent is still invisible.)

12/04/90 pk
BUG FIXES:
    o - #30813 Fixed.
    o - Fixed formatter bug that would cause ![xx] formats to terminate on
        empty strings input to %s arguments.,
    o - Fixed bug in window refreshing that would cause menu colors to be 
        installed sometimes even if no windows were requesting it.
    o - Fixed bug where a textbox would redisplay the cursor when exiting
        even if the cursor was off before the box was put up.
FEATURES CHANGES:
    o - Wrote new player program. See player.doc for specifics.
    o - Put pdr menu in pjhigh.lib and detatched it from local stuff in pj.
        put call to it in converter. Preparing to put some code in player.
INTERNAL CHANGES:
    o - Changed over alot of the pdr stuff to use a local pdr instead of the
        fudged local defined structure.  The local linked in pdrs are "added"
        to a list in the pdr loader via add_local_pdr() after this the 
        load_pdr() will recognize the name and return the locally linked in 
        Pdr for the local type.  This reduces complexity quite a bit.

11/20/90 jk ( pk and jk integrated )
INTERNAL CHANGES:
    o - Got rid of lbegmem.  (Begmem will do.)
NEW FEATURES:
    o - Lots of stuff in convert program.

11/20/90 pk
BUG FIXES:
    o - #30620 Fixed.
    o - #32205 Fixed.  Squeeze will now squeeze even if there are NO colors
        represented on the screen or represented in the cluster. It will clear
        all colors on the screen or cluster to color 0 if not found. It will
        insure that menu colors are installed in the menu color slots if they
        are unoccupied.
    o - #32202 Fixed.
    o - #32200 NAB getting a line cluster on a blank screen will load all (32?)
        colors in the cluster with color 0.  When color 0 is selected as the 
        current color by left clicking on the screen (color 0 area) all 32 
        colors in the cluster are highlighted with the highlight dot. The 32 
        dots in a row form the "line".
    o - #30618 Fixed bracketed appropriate places with disable() enable()
        lsp_ink.
    o - #30615 Fixed.
    o - #30617 Fixed. Note that the spline renderers are linked to the high
        level polygon tool which sets the gradients via a static variable.
    o - #31203 Overwrite mode feature added.  It will overwrite chars until it
        reaches a hard end of line (newline) and will insert before the newline
        or end of text file if in overwrite mode.  The insert key will toggle
        between overwrite and insert mode.  The default on starting to edit a 
        text is insert mode.  Insert mode displays the box cursor over the 
        current character.  Overwrite mode displays a broken cursor with a bar
        over the top and over the bottom of the current character.
    o - #30831 Fixed.
    o - #30824 Fixed.
    o - #31202 Feature added. Page up will move cursor to beginning of text 
        if currently on first page.
    o - #32601 NAB the status line is
        (xleft ytop) (dx dy):  In the case where the starting x and y position
        is 0,0 the dx and dy values will be equal to the absolute position
        values.  It works as designed.
    o - #32203 unable to duplicate bug woorked ok for me with draw tool and
        other tools.
    o - Added flag on ink that indicates if cashe is up or not.  Used in 
        cycle color to flag remake of cashe if ccolor is changed.  Prevents
        unfreed cashes in cycle draw mode.
    o - #30814 fixed pull_leftext() now make first space the widht of a '*'.
    o - Fixed zoom box coors to read with correct sign.
    o - Fixed converter startup/exit sequence to correctly clean up the
        screen. Added unfreed memory report and stack report to exit.
    o - #32600 frame counts now correct.
    o - #30828 position restore pull item disabled if cel not present.
    o - Scroller top name is now not cleared each time scroller is brought up.
INTERNAL CHANGES:
    o - Put a time check in the spray loop to eliminate "blobbing" when 
        spraying with slow inks and large brushes.  Added a special spray
        data record to the redo to make redos synchronous. Time unchecked for 
        speed when brush size <= 2.
FEATURES CHANGES:
    o - In the squeeze and one palette options under palette.  If any colors
        In the menu color slots are unused, then the menu colors are installed
        in these slots to help insure visible menus.
11/??/90 jk
BUG FIXES:
    o - Clock used to glitch off by 1/18th of a second about 1 time
        in 100 frames if the animation was complex enough to take
        more than 1/18th of a second to load an decompress.   Got
        rid of this.  Replay should seem a little smoother in some
        cases.
    o - Clock used to be off by one part in 6.  Now it's good to
        within 1 in 100 anyways.   (Theoretically should be more
        like 1/1000,  but it's hard for me to test to that level.)
    o - Clock used to do wierd things at midnight.  Now less wierd.
