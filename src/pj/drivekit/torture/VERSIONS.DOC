History of changes for driver torture program...

    100  11/01/90 > First version to get a number.  At this point, all dot,
                    line, and rectangle tests are coded.

    101  11/03/90 > Fixed a bug in the rectangle tests that was causing the
                    driver to write offscreen if the screensizes were
                    multiples of 16.  All changes in CHKRRECT.C.

    102  11/05/90 > Added interactive menu handling code.
                  > Added tests for wait_vsync(), set_colors(), mask1blit(),
                    mask2blit(), blit_xxxxx().

    103  11/06/90 > Added tests for tblit_xxxxx().  Fixed problem in
                    init_bytemap_raster(), it now calls the pj function to
                    set the lib pointer properly.

    104  11/12/90 > Added tests for xor_xxxxx(), zoom_xxxxx().  Changed
                    timing from DOS 18.2 hz clock to PJ's 5kz clock (using
                    GETCLOCK.ASM, a faster version of PJ's routines.)

    105  11/14/90 > Added logic to single_step() to check for typical abort
                    keys (x X ESC ^C).  This check occurs regardless of
                    whether the program is running in single-step mode.
                  > Added verify_raster() routine, verifications for:
                    mask1blit, mask2blit, blit_xxxxx, tblit_xxxxx, swap_xxxxx,
                    xor_xxxxx, zoom_xxxxx.  (All tests now have verifications
                    done on them.)
                  > Put the timing routine back to the one in CUTIL.LIB until
                    we figure out what's wrong with the faster one.

    106  11/20/90 > Changed global names to pj_ where needed.
                  > The clock works are finally all straightended out.

    107  11/20/90 > Fixed a problem in zoomblit that was causing a source-
                    overlaps-dest problem in lower resolutions.

    108  01/09/91 > Added additional sanity checking for Raster structure.
                  > Added a default color palette, to ensure good visual
                    contrast for the test patterns.
                  > Fixed all tests so that if the /s option has been used, the
                    single_step() routine gets called even if an error ocurred.
                    (Lets tester eyeball the glitch before program exits.)
                  > Fixed error reporting so that all data verification errors
                    list the screen x/y coordinates where the mismatch ocurred,
                    and the expecting/got values at that location.
                  > Improved the accuracy of timings in segment and rectangle
                    functions, by rearranging time_start()/time_end()/time_it()
                    sequences to filter out more of torture's internal overhead.
                  > Fixed verification bugs in segments, and rectanges testing
                    wherein the driver could return less data on a get_whatever()
                    call than we asked for (could even return no data at all),
                    and we would verify as good because the pattern was still
                    in the pixel buffer from the write-function testing.

    109  01/11/91 > Added a call to init_mem() in main() routine so that
                    pj_malloc will work.  (Peter changed pj_malloc a bit.)

    110  04/25/91 > Fixed reporting of time on the set_colors test. (The time
                    from the set_default_pallete() routine was getting reported
                    instead of the time from the test itself.  Also, Jim must
                    have added a set_gs_register routine at some point recently.

    111  06/22/91 > Fixed some little glitches causes by changes elsewhere in
                    in pj.  There is no more 5000hz _getclock() routine, so
                    _getclock was #define'd to pj_clock_1000 and the CLK_TCK
                    constant was changed to 1000, and the timings are still
                    +- .03 seconds from the old timings.  (IE, old timing run
                    logs are still comparable.)  Also, added dummy old_video()
                    and boxf() routines to keep some lib routines happy.  And
                    finally, fixed set_gs_register to load VGA_SEG not PHAR_SEG.

    112  11/01/91 > Nuked the old GETCLOCK.C module; it's not being used
                    anymore.  Also, removed boxf() and old_video() from
                    TORTURE.C, since they already existed in PJSTUBS.C.

    113  11/06/91 > In CHKDEV.C, added detect() and close_graphics() to the
                    checks for required functions.  PJ assumes these will be
                    present, so NULL pointers will crash PJ, despite what the
                    drivekit docs may say or imply.
                  > Added logic for testing and timing flic playback.  When
                    testing playback, the file TESTFLIC.DIR contains a list
                    of flic files to test (unless overridden with /p).
                  > Late new feature: a new command line switch, /p, was
                    added.  Used as /pfilename.flc it will play the named flic
                    during playback testing.  If the named file isn't a flic
                    it is presumed to be a list of flic files to test.
                  > Tweaked verify_raster() routine to run must faster during
                    verification of flic playback.
