INTRODUCTION & INSTALLATION 

    FLICFADE.POC is an Animator Professional POCO program that produces a 
transition segment to a black screen. The transition, called a "fadein" or 
a "fadeout", can be placed either at the beginning or the end of the 
current flic. Transition segments introduced with this program can have a 
completely variable length. Further, the segment can be in the form of 
either additional frames to the current flic, using the first or last frame 
as appropriate, or overlaid upon existing flic frames. 

    Why FLICFADE? There is an annoying situation that can occur when two 
flics playing in sequence or joined together use different color palettes. 
This can cause bright flashes of other colors on the screen when a VGA 
display's color palette registers are changed. The Animator Professional 
player programs, ANIPLAY.EXE and AAPLAYHI.EXE, have a scripting capability 
that allow for fading in or out from a specific display, which when used to 
go to/from a black screen can eliminate these bright flashes. While the 
'fix' of scripting a fade to/from black is fine for 386 class machines 
which can run AAPLAYHI, it ignores 286 class machines which have to use the 
original Animator player program, AAPLAY.EXE, or other program such as the 
one from Trilobyte, neither of which appear to have such a fade capability. 

    FLICFADE.POC cures this problem by palette animation of the color 
palette registers themselves. In order to visualize how this works, 
consider the case of inserting a transition that adds say 10 frames to the 
beginning of the current flic. The process first inserts 10 additional 
frames, each being a total replica, including color palette, of the 
original first frame of the flic. The color palette of this first frame is 
then forced entirely to black - all colors in the 256 color registers. In 
the second frame, each of the 3 colors in every one of the 256 color 
registers is set to a level of 10% of what it was in the original first 
frame of the flic. The third frame is similar to the second except that all 
color values are now 20% of the original value. The process continues like 
this until one gets back to the original first frame, which maintains the 
original intensity of all the colors in the palette. 
 
    The FLICFADE.ZIP file contains 2 files. These files should be 
copied/moved to the indicated directories, and are: 

    FLICFADE.DOC - This file, containing the documentation. This file is 
                   not needed for program operation. 
    FLICFADE.POC - The ASCII text file containing the program. This file 
                   should be placed in the Animator Pro resource directory 
                   (typically this would be \ANI\RESOURCE) if you want the 
                   program to be instantly available from the Animator Poco 
                   menu. If you just want to access the program by using 
                   the "Use" item from the Poco menu, it can be placed in 
                   any directory. 
 
OPERATION

    Program operation is started from the Animator Professional POCO menu. 
See the Animator Professional documentation for complete instructions 
regarding the operation of this menu. 

    When first invoked, the program shows the Main Control Box which 
displays a message to identify the program, and informs the user that the 
program will overwrite the existing Swap buffer. This control box also 
displays 4 buttons, one of which must be selected for operation to proceed. 
The four buttons, and their purposes are: 

    Beginning - Selecting this button will place the transition at the 
                beginning of the current Animator Pro flic.
 
    Ending    - Selecting this button places the transition at the end of 
                the current Animator Pro flic.
 
    About     - This button displays an information box about the program, 
                including the version number and author information. When 
                the Continue button on the information box is selected, 
                program control is returned to this control box. 

    Cancel    - Selection of this control button terminates the FLICFADE 
                program and returns control to Animator Professional. The 
                FLICFADE program is also terminated at this stage if the 
                user right clicks with the mouse. 

    Once the user has made the decision to proceed, selecting either the 
Beginning or Ending button on the Main Control Box, a Secondary Control Box 
is displayed, with a message asking if you want to add frames to the flic 
or use the existing flic frames. Control buttons in this box are: 

    Add      - Selecting this button adds additional frames to the current 
               flic. The additional frames will become the transition 
               frames. 

    Existing - Selecting this button will use existing frames in the flic 
               to form the transition. It is important to note that when 
               this has been selected, the transition's size cannot be any 
               larger than the current flic. Also, the current flic is 
               modified, and the original form of the flic is lost. 
               RECOVERY IS NOT POSSIBLE. It is recommended that you save 
               the current flic to the disk before selecting this action. 

    Cancel   - Selecting Cancel (or right clicking the mouse) returns 
               user control to the Main Control Box. 

    When the New or Existing control buttons on the Secondary Control Box 
are selected, a slider type control box is presented allowing entry of the 
number of frames that will be in the transition. This will be the number of 
new frames to be inserted in the flic if the New button was selected, or 
the number of frames that will be overwritten if the Existing button was 
exercised on the secondary control box. The user is also allowed the 
option of canceling the entire operation again, which returns control to 
the Main Control Box. 

    Once the number of transition frames has been selected, the entry is 
checked for validity, i.e. it can never be a negative number nor can the 
number of existing frames be exceeded if you're going to be overwriting 
existing frames. Invalid entries here are flagged with an error control box 
which lets the user know of the error, its reason, and returns control to 
the Secondary Control Box when the Continue button is selected. 

    Assuming that the number of transition frames was valid, the insertion 
of the transition segment proceeds ahead at roughly the same speed that 
Animator Professional exhibits when rendering. When the entire operation is 
concluded, control is automatically returned to Animator Professional.

OTHER NOTES

    It is well to remember that the flics resulting from FLICFADE do NOT 
have anything like a normal or typical animation sequence. It's not that 
there is anything illegal done, there is not! The technique is actually 
very efficient animation in terms of the effect achieved versus flic size. 
But until the advent of POCO in Animator Pro, there was no easy way to do 
it. With this in mind, there are some other comments that can be made. 

    Using the Animator Single Color Palette. You can't. The transitions 
produced by FLICFADE are not compatible, since FLICFADE is forcing multiple 
color palettes in the flic.  

    Transitions with Existing Frames. When using existing frames as part of 
the transmission segment, the color palettes are adjusted on a frame by 
frame basis, using the individual frame's palette as the baseline for 
actual palette modification. This is done so as not to upset any existing 
palette animation that maybe present with the current flic. 

    Operation with the player programs. I have tested sample flics at 
various resolutions on the Autodesk player programs. There is no problem 
with AAPLAY.EXE, ANIPLAY.EXE, or AAPLAYHI.EXE. There is a quirk using the 
Windows Player program if the original flic used the same white color used 
by Windows itself. It appears to be the same problem one gets trying to use 
the scripting transition fading capability of the Windows Player program, 
i.e. when run, the white is displayed as black. Best guess is that if 
you've used the Windows player program including the scripting transition 
fading without a problem previously, it will probably be okay. There was no 
problem with the limited sample of flics that have been tried with version 
0.73 of the Trilobyte player program. If you're using 0.6 of the Trilobyte 
player, you need to get version 0.73 immediately, as these flics send 0.6 
into never-never land. 

BUGS, PROBLEMS, and FREEware 

    I wrote this program to solve a problem I ran into trying to distribute 
presentation material into a world that isn't as well endowed with computer 
capability as I am. There are still an awful lot of standard VGA 286 class 
machines out there, which means using 320x200 flics with AAPLAY.EXE as the 
player program. The FLICFADE program passes the Alpha test, me, since I'm 
happy with it and use it. But you are the Beta test, and there is no 
certainty of bug free performance. If you find a bug and/or see 
improvements, let me know and I'll try and fix/correct/improve it. But 
please remember that I'm not doing this full time for a living... 

    Which gets around to just why I'm placing this program into the public 
domain. I don't believe that it is ethical to request money for work that 
someone else has already paid for, in this case my employer, the Naval 
Research Laboratory. (Actually, it is all of you - the taxpayers.) Couple 
that with the fact that I can't really support it as a product, (even if 
what support I can do might be better than a couple of large outfits I can 
think of) and it becomes down right wrong to ask for money. 

    I'll be happy to answer any questions. Please be advised that I read 
the Compuserve mailbox infrequently, maybe once a week or so, so it would 
be best to direct e-mail to my normal Internet address, which I read at 
least daily. From Compuserve you can direct mail to the Internet address.
