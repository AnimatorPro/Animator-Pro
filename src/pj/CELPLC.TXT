CelPlc is a POCO program for Animator Pro which allows precise
placement of Cels. The Cel may be moved, rotated and optionally
pasted with opaque ink. The Cel is moved by dragging the
mouse/pen and rotated by right clicking the mouse/pen. The
amount of rotation per click is adjustable, initially defaulting
to 5 degrees, but adjustable to any value between 1 and 180
degrees. Direction of rotation may be reversed at any time.



Place the file in the ANI\RESOUCE directory which will cause it
to appear on the POCO menu. Load the Cel with the image to be
placed. Rotation only makes sense if the contains an image which
is smaller then the screen image size. Click on the CelPlc entry
to invoke the routine.



Drag to move the Cel and show the position of the Cel.

Right click to rotate the Cel about the Z axis.

Press <-> to reverse the direction of rotation.

Press <1> to set the rotation to 1 degrees per click.

Press <5> to set the rotation to 5 degrees per click.

Press <0> to bring up a slider box which sets the rotation to
any value from 1 to 180.

Press <space> to end the function leaving the Cel in its new
position, but not actually pasting the Cel.

Press <return> to complete the paste and exit the function.

Press <esc> to cancel the function and leave the Cel in its
original position.
