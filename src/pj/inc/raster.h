    The raster header structure and other sets of structured fields
    used to make rasters have been made into macros so other code may make up 
    rasters without.using.lots.of.dots and still maintain a common structure 
    notice that there is NO semicolon ';' after the last field so that 
    the macro will have a semicolon after it when used so things look and
    act right
