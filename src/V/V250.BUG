Ok, I edited the bug list you sent, deleted all fixed bugs, left in some
of the  Z and Y listings, and added a few new ones.  New list is file
BUGS in my space.  (Only 12 second download -- must be getting shorter.)

Great, I'll go pick up your bugs.  (BTW would be easier for me if we start
giving numbers to the bug files.  Ie bugs.250 for this one.  (I'm always
aftr  raid I'm going to overwirt   rt ite some ancient and cherished list of bugs with
some new upstart....)
