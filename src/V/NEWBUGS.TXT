Subject: new fatal bug
Status: RO


v248 has a fatal lock up with the use of Clear Pic, and all the
Effects (in the Pic menu), except Trails and Blue numbers.   A quick
survey of the rest of the program showed nothing major.  Minor bug
while quickly selecting Segment Flip or Flip 5: a portion of the drop-down
menu is left on the screen.

(Sorry to get your last message.  I thought you and Gary were getting along.
Wrong again.  Hope you didn't think my previous message was a request for
a new feature.  It wasn't.)
