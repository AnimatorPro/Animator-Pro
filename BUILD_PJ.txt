How to build PJ (Animator Pro) in DOSBox
========================================

 1. Install in a fresh DOS environment:

    * Watcom C in \WATCOM
    * Phar Lap in \PHAR386
    * Turbo C (in \TC) or Borland C (in \BORLANDC)

    Tested with Watcom C 8.5 / Phar Lap 5 / Turbo C 2.0 / Borland C 3.1.

    The 'make' program from Turbo C or Borland C is necessary, but
    likely nothing else.  You may have better luck with Turbo C make.

 2. Put their respective BIN directories in your PATH.
    Set the environment variables for Watcom C.
    You might put in AUTOEXEC.BAT:

        call C:\WATCOM\AUTOC386.BAT
        set LIB=C:\WATCOM\LIB386\DOS;C:\WATCOM\LIB386;C:\PHAR386\LIB
        set PATH=%PATH%;C:\PHAR386\BIN;C:\TC\BIN;C:\BUILD\BIN

 3. You may need to replace the Phar Lap run386.exe program by another
    (more recent?) version if any .EXP programs crash immediately.
    Check by building a simple protected mode program with Watcom C:

        wcl386 /l=pharlap hello.c
        run386 hello.exp

 4. Make a directory \BUILD\BIN expected by the build system.
    It must be on your PATH.

        mkdir \build
        mkdir \build\bin

 5. Copy Borland MAKE.EXE to TCMAKE.EXE on your PATH, e.g. \BUILD\BIN

 6. The command SETWC386 must exist on your PATH.  If you followed the
    instructions above then it can just be an empty file:

        echo. >\build\bin\setwc386.bat

    Otherwise it should set up the environment for the Watcom C
    compiler.  You can look at src/PJ/ASL/BIN/SETWC386.BAT

 7. Make the src/PJ directory visible in DOS as \PAA.
    You could symlink PJ on the host to PAA in the guest directory.
    Be sure to restart DOSBox afterwards.

 8. The build system likes to beep.
    Copy BEEP.BAT into \BUILD\BIN or whatever.

 9. You can now build inside DOSBox:

        cd \PAA
        make

10. If successful, you can start it with:

        run386 pj.exp
