Autodesk Animator, and its later revision Animator Pro was a popular paint and 
animation package originally released in 1989, and created by Jim Kent, Gary 
Yost, and Peter Kennard
Here is the original source code, with the hope that further 
improvements and maintenance can be incorporated in the future, and also
for today's developers to learn from its techniques and design,  some aspects 
of which are still better than those of modern graphics packages.

In its current form, it is rather untidy. I am engaged in an effort to make the source more comprehensible, and provide compilation
instructions.
