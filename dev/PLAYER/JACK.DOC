PJ Player notes: 12/31/90  (PK - : comments by Peter 12/31/90 happy new year.)
 
PK - I reviewed the notes below.  I see the value in many of the suggestions,
     My top priority at present is to get the script commands loadfli and
     freefli reliably working to allow flis to be loaded into ram from the 
     script in a manner optimizing ram use.  Only frames needed put into ram
     and optimizing things for playback speed.  First frames are not loaded if
     faded in, ring frames are not loaded if not looped, and hopefully framse
     that can be accessed faster than the playback speed requires will not be
     in ram either, but this is a more complex optimization.  I have put in
     a please insert floppy in drive x: requestor for loading up flis from 
     floppies. 
     
        When the ram stuff mostly done and tested I'll start on the rest. 
     I'm pretty sure I will get the search path used in the script changed. 
     I would like to know what you see as the priority of these items.


-    After having talked to several of the Autodesk people who
     use the AA Player program for business presentations, I
     found that their biggest wishlist item is to be able to step
     back one or two sequences and replay something.  Typically,
     this happens during a pause.  An audience member wants to
     see something they just played (either a replay of the flic
     that is paused, or the previous flic).  I guess the
     Keychoice could be used for something like this, but the
     script would be pretty complicated when all the user wants
     to do is step back once or twice, then just continue from
     there.  The nicest solution would be a key or mouse click,
     available only during a pause, which steps back one sequence
     with each click.  Since many of the presenters use a mouse
     with a long cord for their presentations, perhaps a left
     mouse button, plus some keyboard alternative would work
     best.  This way, the presenter can right-click to move
     forward, and left-click to step back.

PK - It might be possible to have a "go back to start of THIS fli" on right
     click. which would only go back to the beginning of the fli currently 
     playing or currently paused if it is NOT a fli preceding a keychoice.
     It would be some work, but I see it's value.

-    We need a script command, similar to the Type command, to
     set the screen display driver and the screen resolution.  If
     this command is in the script (as the first command), the
     AA.CFG setting is overridden.  Otherwise the AA.CFG setting
     is used.

PK - This would be nice.  The intention is to have a command line arg
     which is used to start up the player. This was in some old test versions
     and is now broken.  Putting it in the script would make a script a bit 
     machine dependent and be more work.  

     ie:  player script.scr -v driver.drv 0  
     (driver "driver.drv" mode 0)

     It would overide and config setting.  This would be a lot easier
     than putting it in the script itself, (extra error checking) and it would
     only be possible as the first line in the first script and would remain in
     effect until the script exits.

 
-    I recommend the Player take its default drive path from the
     location of the script file rather than the location of the
     Player program.  The old AA Player was a single executable
     that was easy to relocate to any directory holding files. 
     The current Player is locked down by all its resource files,
     so it's a lot easier to place your script in the directory
     holding most of your data.  Thus, if the Player is in
     d:\pjplay\player, and your files and script are in
     e:\present1\myscript.scr, you can type from the pjplay
     directory: player e:\present1\myscript.scr, and won't need
     to include the complete drive path with every single file in
     your script.

PK - I will look at taking the path from the first script loaded. Seems a
     a good idea.

     Currently the path is NOT where the program is procured from 
     (via dos path) but where it is RUN from ie:

     cd d:\scripts
     player test.scr  // if player is found via dos path */

     this would make the default path d:\scripts\...
     This is identical to PJ, I used the pj library.

 
-    The RGB values used by the Player program should be the same
     as the values used by the sliders in PJ. Thus, if we have
     RGB sliders ranging from 0-255, these should be the settings
     entered in the Player script.  (It doesn't make sense to
     expect the user to convert a color they've set in the
     Palette screen as 64,102,233, to whatever the equivalent is
     in floating point 0.0 to 10.0.)
 
PK - Don't see why not.

-    Blue Sky (ignore this, just thinking) : If the text edit
     code was included in the Player, you could edit your scripts
     from within the Player.

PK - This would add needless size to the player and would allow less flis to be
     resident in ram. about 20k less ram.  I might throw in the browse which 
     will only add about 1k.
