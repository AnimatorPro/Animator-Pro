Animator Pro A.K.A.
===================

Animator Pro, (A.K.A. Autodesk Animator Pro, Ani Pro, PJ Paint, or simply PJ) 
is a 256 color paint and animation package for MSDOS. It was popular 
in the early to mid 1990's for game art, online animation, 
business presentations and occasional TV productions.

Originally released in 1989 by Autodesk, and licensed from Yost Group, Ani Pro 
was created by Peter Kennard, Gary Yost and Jim Kent. Jim Kent kept copyrights 
to the source code, thus allowing him to grant me permission to make it 
available to you here. For my part, I wish to do my best to preserve and 
document this tiny bit of significant computer history, promote the usefulness 
of this program and hopefully improve and modify it for future and current 
users, many of whom still find it very useful and fun.
