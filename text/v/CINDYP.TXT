I tested the macro on the xt with dos 2.1.  It hung in the same place.

so xt 286
Compaq 386s 16 mhrtz - both hang

Compaq386/25 is fine.

I am downloading nomouse now and will keep you posted.

I have attached the macro and sent you the files separately.

        Sounds like a good idea.  Later.  I'll get the basic declarations
and functionally non-major stuff done first in the next day or so and then
look at it.  I'm starting to get to know how things are done slowly.  I'll
then look at other issues such as file organization/functionality header files
ansi function declaration files (maybe a ???.dcl or ???.pub file for each ???.c
and each ???.asm file which could be programaticly generated as the public
declarations for all public calls in the file) If you have any ideas on same 
let me know.  I'll try to get over tomorrow to look a contracts etc.

The same macro (test.rec) run without playing the different composites 
does not hang.  It is only when you play the flick over and over in the 
macro.  As I mentioned this happens on a Compaq386s 16 mhrtz and on the 
xt 286 It does not occur on the Compaq386/25.

I loaded Crop32 on the XT with dos 2.1 and I got a Plink86 Overlay 
loader can't find Crop.exe message.

Just a little note.  I am sure you want to hear a little note but I just 
wanted to let you know that I did the same thing with the Join command.  
When I repeatedly played a flic in the macro then eventually it hangs.  
If I  run through the same series of steps without playing the macro it 
is fine.  

Hope this might help isolate the problem by the fact that it really 
seems only to be playing a flic in a macro.
