
x1. Underlay composite color fitting screwed up.

?2. Small things dont seem to rotate 90 degrees completely accurately.

x3. Color paste and blend not disabled when no cut yet.

4. Macros made pounding on down arrow and n keys eventually loose
   sync somehow.  (With wildly unpredictable subsequent interpretation
   of the input stream!)

x5. Hit b: on file selector with no drive in.  Runs ok, but missing hilight
  at end on fail.

o6. In Zoom x4 looks like zoomit() will make things off by 2 pixels 
   if top menu bar is up.  (Not fixed but walked around currently.)

?7. Often doing a separate or fill in Zoom will lead to the amazing flashing
   screen that eventually calms down syndrome.

x8. Hollow circle with brush not right in gradient inks.

x9. Macro abort when over a yes/no dialog crashes!

x10. Loop segment when only one frame - hang city...

11. Problem with flip 5 when you've made changes to frame 1 but haven't
    gone to a new frame yet?
