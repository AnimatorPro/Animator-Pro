I don't know anything at all about DOS at that level.  I'd try asking
Bob Elman (acad!bob) or Greg Lutz (acad!greg), as they may have encountered
this before.

Actually, this is the kind of "bug" that doesn't excite me too much.
Do you crash your car when driving at 100 MPH and you try to put your
hands in your pockets?  Well, don't do that!

I swore I would never again get involved in naming a product, but "RGB
Animator" just made me sick.  Anything else is an improvement.  Even
``Refried Rat Turds'' would be memorable, if not appealing.  My suggestions
were "Autodesk Animator" or "Autodesk Video Animator".  The only thing I
have against "Video Paint" is that it's likely to be perceived as a
paint package, ignoring all the animation facilities that make it unique
(to me, "Video" doesn't imply animation, though it may to people more
with-it than I).

Good luck with DOS.
