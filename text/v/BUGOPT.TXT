Just got through rereading the ref docs.  (Wow, whatta bore!)  Anyway,
everything is looking pretty good, but I found a bug in the new optics
routine and knew you'd look forward to hearing about it.  I haven't
spent much time checking it out completely, but it's connected to 
using Path.  If you set up a couple of Spin/Turns, and change the center,
and, maybe, fool around with the Sizing and its center, then draw a 
Spline path, when you do a wireframe, at the end of the move, you'll
get either an 'Out of Memory,' or once I got a 'Zero Memory Request.'
Also, the axis icon will be pasted to the end position on screen.
(The 'Zero Memory...' I first got after doodling with some Size stuff.
The Out of Mem.. came after doing Spin/Center/Turns plus Spline path,
with no Size adjustments.
