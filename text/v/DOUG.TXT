
-Due to the time, crossfades are unusable except in limited
applications. (Like a 6 frame fade)

-I would be nice if mask did NOT alter the cell image.

-Didnt get stencil the first time thru. (The word mask helped).

-How do play speeds relate to frames per sec?

-The frame bar should apply to playbacks.  This would be more useful
than flip 5, as the user can set the frames to flip thru.

-Sliders (optics, etc) need a zeroing function.

-Used sort on clown and it put a white frame around the pic.

-Moe brush shapes needed.

-Zoom...this needs to have more levels...50% is not enuff.  A serious
limitation for detail work.

-Line tool needs a continuous line feature.

-Glow does not seem right...will try this again.

thru 1/20
......................................................................

-Would like to see crop and get use a polygon instead of a box to
define areas.

-Seperate leaves a one pixel vert line unchanged on the right of the
screen.

-Translate doesnt describe "move cell".

-Would like to control the portion of the screen that is shrunk on
shrink x2. (How bout shrink x3 and x4?)

-Cel mask not working??

-Flip range should cycle.  One time thru isnt enuff to observe the
flow.

-Soften.  Disappearing curser makes this hard to guide movement.

-Getting dumped from menus is a pain from time to time.  (Like grid,
where at least 2 selections are required most of the time)

-Petal.....HoHummm.  Good for flower artists?

-RPoly looks bad after 10 points or so, specially with thicker
brushes.

-Seems like seperate should be associated with the color menu instead
of tools.

-Seperate (Box)..The need is for a defined area (poly), not a box. 
Seldom is the area to change located in a box.

-The dots indicating the selected color are vera small.  Maybe a box
around it or larger pixels?

-Inks (ADD).  What is this for?  What does it do exactly?

-Didnt get glow either?

-Xor has always been a mystery to me? (logical?)
