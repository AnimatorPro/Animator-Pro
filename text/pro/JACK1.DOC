Jack's Bugs 'n Stuff
                             (PJ48)
 
Here are some bugs and notes I've been putting together while
starting rewrites on the tutorials.  There are a number of bugs
here which are not in the latest version of the QA list I just
received (11/19).
 
-    Flic/Effects/Trails: When you do a transparent trails over a
     number of frames, then right-click to abort, after selecting
     Yes at the prompt, the trails procedure does not abort.
 
-    Insert Tween appears to be broken:
 
          -    Get a small cel, then clear all frames.
          -    Make two frames.
          -    Paste the cel at the top of frame #1, then move to
               frame #2 and paste the cel toward the bottom of
               the screen.
          -    Select Insert Tween and one of the two inserted
               guide cels will appear smeared.
 
-    Undo in the Color Palette screen erases the last loaded
     picture:
 
          -    After doing a Reset, load a picture.
          -    In the Palette screen, change one of the RGB
               sliders for any color.
          -    Click on the Undo button and the picture is
               erased.
 
-    Mask/Create doesn't create a complete mask when using a fat
     brush with the Draw tool.  To repeat, turn on Mask/Create
     then draw a squiggle with a large brush (say, 16).  Activate
     the mask, then draw a filled box of a different color over
     the masked area.  You'll see "cracks" in the sides of the
     drawn squiggle.
 
-    The menu colors are not maintained by the Default.fli file. 
     No matter what my colors are set to when I save a Settings
     file, when I reload the Settings file, the menu colors go
     back to the original default settings (Blues).  Also, once
     these menu colors are set, selecting Reset doesn't reset
     them to the menu colors saved by the configuration.
 
-    Tween: Right-click doesn't cancel the drawing of shapes like
     Star, Petal, Rpoly, and Oval.  This is inconsistent with the
     way the same shapes are created using the Tools.
 
-    Tween: When Both is turned on in the Active menu, there's no
     way to know which shape is going to be replaced by the next
     drawn shape.
 
-    Tween: If you change the colors in the first or second slots
     of the mini-palette, the colors of the start and end shapes
     are not changed until after a redraw (caused by such as View
     Loop).
 
-    Tween: The items in the Shape menu should be in alphabetical
     order as they are in the Tools panel.
 
-    Tween: [Backspace] doesn't work as an Undo as it does on the
     main screen.
 
-    Tween: The [C] cycle draw works with the Trails option but
     not with rendered tweens.  Why not?
 
-    I've noticed that when you change a color in the mini-
     palette now, the changed color becomes the current color. 
     This is written up as a key color bug (#30611), but looks to
     be a basic change in the color selection process.  Is this a
     bug or a change in color selection procedure?
 
-    The current system of storing filenames along with paths in
     the aa.cfg file sets up a dangerous situation in which it's
     very easy to write over an existing file after rebooting the
     program.  For example, you might save a pic called
     GRAPH1.GIF, then Quit/Abandon the program.  A week later,
     you start the program up and when you go to save a picture,
     the filename defaults to GRAPH1.GIF.
 
-    For purposes of the tutorials, we need two or three easily
     identifiable colors in the mini-palette slots (besides the
     first two slots).  For example, we used to be able to tell
     the reader to select orange, or light blue, or dark red, or
     green.  Now that most of the mini-palette colors are
     designer shades, it becomes that much more complicated to
     simply tell the reader which color to pick. ("Click on Santa
     Fe Avocado Green and draw a circle...")
 
-    Here are some inconsistencies with the Anim Cel system:
 
          -    In the Cel drop-down on the main screen, we have
               "Turn."  On the Anim Cel panel, a "Rotate" button
               serves the same purpose _except_ that you can't
               click inside the cel to move it.  At the same
               time, there is a "Turn" item in the Position menu
               of the Anim Cel screen which serves a slightly
               different purpose.  I suggest changing the button
               on the Anim Cel panel to "Turn" and making
               consistent with the main Cel/Turn function so you
               can click inside the cel to move it.  In addition,
               change the "Turn" in the Position menu to
               "Rotate."
 
          -    I suggest turning off the "To Cursor" button as a
               default, since that's the method used by the main-
               screen cel and will be familiar to all AA
               upgraders.  Also, it's disorienting to have the
               cel jump around after having gotten used to moving
               cels the other way on the main screen.
 
          -    When you transfer from the Anim Cel panel to the
               Inks panel, the name in the current tool slot is
               "Move" (which is also the name of a tool).  Why
               isn't this "Anim Cel"?  (Actually, you could make
               this easier by simply disabling the current tool
               slot in all transfer instances while still
               displaying the current tool.  Since there's an
               exit icon in the Inks panel, the user shouldn't
               have any problem figuring out how to exit the
               panel.)
 
          -    We have the term "Multi-cel" in the Time Select
               panel, "Advance Cel" in the Options menu of the
               Anim Cel screen, "Sprite" on the Anim Cel panel,
               not to mention the term "Anim Cel" itself.  Some
               of these, such as Multi-cel and Advance Cel, serve
               the same purpose.  Others are vaguely close to the
               same.  Any ideas on how to get these more
               consistent?
 
          -    On the subject of the Advance Cel mode, here's a
               suggestion: Change the [K] button to something
               like [A] (or whatever) and make it an advance cel
               toggle.  Four reasons:
 
                    1) I suspect that turning on and off the cel
                    advance is more important than the key color
                    mode (which I seldom turn off).
 
                    2) You really want to know if cel advance is
                    active while in the Home screen performing
                    pastes over time.
 
                    3) It might make it more intuitive to right-
                    click on that type of button to get to the
                    Anim Cel screen, than right-clicking on a Key
                    Color button.
 
                    4) It would get rid of that extra MultiCel
                    button that's floating around in the Time
                    Select panel.
 
          -    It would be real nice to label the frame control
               icons in the lower left of the Anim Cel panel "Cel
               Frames."
 
-    Here are some inconsistencies I've noticed with upper/lower
     case:
 
     -    As a general rule, use init-cap for all words.  If
          there are two words in an item, both words should have
          init caps.
 
     -    Flic/Save segment should be Save Segment.
 
     -    In the Trace menu, the following need to be double init
          caps: Next Blue, Insert Tween, Erase Guides, Clip
          Changes, Repeat Changes, Loop Segment, Segment Flip,
          Flip Five.
 
     -    In the Frames menu: the Time Select button.
 
     -    On the Optics panel: Clear Move and Clear Track.
 
     -    In the Optics Presets menu: Clear All, Pull Back, and
          Spin Small.
 
     -    In the Optics Movement menu: In Slow, Out Slow.
 
     -    In the Optics Element menu: Set Tween and Set Cel.
 
     -    On the Palette screen, practically everything needs
          init caps, including the title button on the Palette
          panel, all the menu titles and all the items in the
          various drop-down menus.
 
     -    On the Tween screen, "End to Start" is fine in the
          Tween menu.  Ease Out needs init caps in the Options
          menu.
 
     -    On the Join panel: Match Size and Swap Ends.
 
     -    In the Anim Cel screen: Save Cursor in the Cel menu; To
          Center in the Position menu; Clear Key Color, Fit
          Colors, Render Under, One Color, and Advance Cel in the
          Options menu.  Blue Last in the Sprite option box.
 
     -    In the Macro menu, all double-word items need init.
          caps.
 
     -    In the Extra/Configure menu, all should be init. cap,
          with the exception of "for" in Path for Temporary
          Files.
 
     -    The f/s/a buttons are upper-case in some panels and
          lower case in others.
 
-    We need a keyboard alternate system soon for documentation
     purposes.  This is especially true of the drop-down menu key
     alts.  Wasn't there some plan to do this with underlined or
     bolded letters?  What happened to it?
 
-    Who makes the final decision on the default menu colors? Do
     we hire a color coordinator? Personally, I prefer the Greys
     because they're neutral to any colors you might be using on
     the drawing screen, but the inactive buttons (such as Mask)
     are completely invisible in the current Gray scheme.
 
-    By the way, "Lassoo" is misspelled, it should be "Lasso."
