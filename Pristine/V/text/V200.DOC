BUG FIXES:

o - Effects menu stuff works over many frames.  (fixed rpmuzauto() )


Video Paint 249

BUG FIXES:

o - Clear pic and many other functions work again.  Tried to save 12
    bytes last time around and slipped a parameter.

o - Cursor doesnt stick to screen on a flip segment.  

INTERNAL CHANGES:  (Should not be noticable except unless I made a mistake)

o - Finished commenting a3d.c

o - Broke optical pull-downs into a separate file from a3d.c 
	Called it a3dpull.c - what an imagination I've got.


Video Paint 248

o - Fixed angle display hopping around with negative numbers in
    turn cel. (After backup)

o - Fixed single frame segment "play segment" hang.  (After backup)

Internal Changes (Not visible unless I screwed up...)

o - More commenting.  Heavy on:

		config.c
		cpack.c
		csort.c
		cthread.c
		cursorda.c
		debug.c
		decoder.c
		diskerr.c
		dissolve.c
		dosstuff.c
	light: through comprs.c

o - Started commenting a3d.c (optics code except for the part about the
    menu...)  -  wow what a friggin huge file.

o - small optimizations on:
		csort.c
		config.c (just took out unused temp file name)

o - Changed video_form to vscreen for easier typing.

Video Paint 247

o - Sped up simple Cel pastes.

o - Did a small change that will make it more likely for temp file
    to survive intact on program crash or power failure (well if on
	hard disk on power failure).

o - Starting to comment the source code.  Put brief comment at the
    start of files through a3d.c to cel.c , and heavily commented:
		auto.c
		bfile.c
		blue.c
		cel.c

o - Did some misc refining/code squeezing on:
		auto.c 
		bfile.c
		cel.c
		render.c
		savefli.c
		vpsubs.c

Video Paint 246		*******   1st Beta

o - Quit requestor warns you if you have unsaved changes.

o - Files menu has a mini time control set.

o - Changed 'splice' to 'join' in case I ever implement 'save segment'.

o - Changed about box a little.  Put in a line "GARY YOST" that
    you can do a binary edit on (lots of surrounding spaces) with
	name of person doing beta test to make people more paranoid about
	lending out their beta copy to our competitors.  (The 'big secret'
	GARY YOST is still in there for further confibulations and
	security concious freemishness....)

Video Paint 245

o - You can turn off coordinate displays (and color top line displays too)
    with new item in configure....)

o - Stretch and rotate cel display meaningful numbers.

o - Fixed a bug where width/height of displayed cel was always displayed
    as 0/0 in a number of places.

o - Fixed bug where you'd get 'out of memory' after optics wireframe
    if you had a path.

o - Wrong res, use crop to convert error message when loading GIF is
    in the right colors.

o - When you abort a macro when it's over a yes/no dialog already
	(Happens frequently when macro gets out of phase somehow due to
	menus being moved or whatever) you don't crash.  (Ie yes/no dialogs
	can handle recursion now.)

Video Paint 244

o - Brighten changed to effect fully saturated colors (and black a little.)
    It's sort of a cross between the old brighten and tint with white.

o - Got "one palette" as a palette drop down option.  Try it out on
    a fli with a bunch of your favorite GIF's.  Not too bad.  Actually
	try it on 16 Neochrome conversions and you won't lose anything at all.

Video Paint 243

o - Curve renamed to spline.

o - Edge in is a new tool.

o - Changed default tool settings.  Gel is out.  Poly is in.

o - Took out a 'printf' error message when loading a bad font file
    that used to put 'xxx.fnt truncated 2' in ugly IBM fat font over
	your drawing screen.

o - Updated the help descriptions for drawing tools and inks.

o - Circle with big brush better in gradient inks.

o - Removed a couple of debugging dialogs that never come up.

o - Fixed missing drive hilight when you try to CD to a drive that
    won't respond.  (Reverts back to old drive as before, but hilit
	properly now.)

o - Ado center gets spun with the rest. (For better or worse...)

o - Flip 5 has visible key equivalent of '5'

o - Flip Segment has visible key equiv of [cr] (for carraige return)

o - Pixelate 1x1 comes back real fast.

o - 1st frame of trails real fast.

o - Combine color maps has less shuffling.

o - Timing of flip5 and flip range a little different.  There are longer
    pauses at the beginning and end to help separate the animation 
	playback from the jump back to current frame.  Flip 5 goes 1/2
	speed.  (Mostly when you only want 5 frames you're sort of
	doing a 'zoom' over time to study animation in detail.  You
	do this mostly during the early stages of a motion study.)

o - Loop segment in there.

Video Paint 242

o - Sep. tool in zoom x4 don't get screen shifted up 2 lines.

o - Spray width slider goes from 1 to 100 not 0 to 100.  (Even avoids
    a zero divide crash that way.)

o - Summagraphics tablet driver in there.   Will pretty much only work with
    the type of tablet I've got  (12"x12" MM series).

o - Put in lots more of 'semantic' changes from Jack's details file.

Video Paint 241

o - Spray speed slider goes from 1 to 100 not 0 to 100. (After backup).

o - Paste Under with key color in non-opaque inks works more like
    Jack thinks it should.

o - An asterisk appears by the current scratch drive when you set 
    temp drive.

o - Composite underlay is much better.  (Code is smaller too.)  

o - 'Combine colors' in compositing won't hang the machine when 
    the color maps are different but still have many of the same
	colors.

Video Paint 240

o - Tint cancel bug nuked.

o - Wrap on horizontal scroll titling with text window moved partially 
    offscreen nuked.

o - RIght click over turns sliders in optics seems better.

o - Maybe discreet inks are working right?

o - Paste and blend are greyed out if no cut has occured in palette.

o - Default center works with splines and polys.

o - Spin small only takes you back 500.

Video Paint 239

o - Don't lose ink strength when go to new draw tool.

o - Requestor informing you no mouse available comes up in visible colors.

o - Right click on optics sliders (except reduce/enlarge) zeros them.
    Right click over tens/cont/bias in curve does same thing.



Video Paint 238

o - After save splice fails you don't get a bad magic number written to
    the temp file header.

o - Ram disk full response is getting close to the way it should be.  It'll
    warn you when ram-disk get's less than 200K on program startup or any
	time you invoke a function that could be done over many frames.
	Then you get shuttled to the scratch drive config section, which has
	been changed too.

Video Paint 237

o - Call 'idle interrupt' when waiting for input.  This will make your
    print spooler keep printing and do good things for TSR's that
	process data in the background.

o - Replaced 'colors used' in info with free space on scratch drive.

o - Saving files to a full disk recovers better and faster.  (no bogus
    color map, doesn't attempt to reread file).

o - Splice and backwards recover from full disk situations better.

o - Trying to make 'load fli' recover from full disk better.

o - The '9' key shows you free space on all drives.  Not a permanent
    feature - just a step towards some of the ram-disk-full management
	stuff I'm working on.

Video Paint 236

o - Sped up no menus on screen drawing a bit.  Most noticable in
    separate opaque over multiple frames.

o - Deblinked cursor a bit I hope draw with zoom and on slower 
    machines.

o - Reproduced macro play bug.  Has to do with hitting the keys to
    start and stop playback.  Can usually regenerate it with a bunch
	of down arrows mixed with some n's.

o - Made inks local.  Yay!  Think I got all the defaults about to my
    liking too.  (Most everyone 50% except jumble and split).  Dither
	is local too.  Gradient dither defaults to on, the rest to off.

o - Got rid of slider in add ink (since uses current color now).

Video Paint 235

o - Further work to get macros more reliable in a few situations where
    there were timing dependencies.  Still not sure if it's 100%
	(need more testing with macros that include 'plays') but it's
	certainly much much better.  Basically am including a little
	sync info in the macro stream.

o - created 'makeicon' utility for converting Vpaint .cel's into icons.

o - Large fonts show up in text sub-menu with their name in system font
    instead of plain invisible.

o - Optics slider arrows show x/y/z orientation.

Video Paint 234

o - Changed optics file format a trifle to make future expansion easier.

o - Optics file type changed from ".3FX" to ".OPT".

o - Added some pad bytes now and then in FLI to force frames of a fli
    to start at even offsets for faster DMA.

o - Backwards is now backwards...    The vpaint ones aren't getting
	the ...'s just 'cause I think having the drop down 3 characters
	less wide is nicer than that little bit of consistency.

o - Gif file signatures are checked to ward off future incompatible
    revisions of GIF.

Video Paint 233

o - Load/save polygon implemented.  Files... is a selection on the
    polygon drawing tools menu.  It effects curve as well, but not
	room there sadly.

o - After a multi-frame operation current frame is properly marked clean.
	(Meaning after waiting 1/2 hour for the 'transparent trails' to get
	through, you don't have to wait another 5 seconds for it to re-recompress
	the current frame before you play it back.)

o - Add ink add's current color, not ink strength.

o - Glow ink is back.  It's a little different though now, more like the
    local color cycle Jack described it as.  Colors inside the cluster
	are bumped to the next color in the cluster.  Colors outside are not
	effected.

o - Took out the stuff for non 320x200 GIF's and replaced it with a
    suggestion to use cropper.

o - Undo works better after a load pic.

Video Paint 232

o - Curve and polygon don't disrupt macros.

o - Closed curves that aren't filled don't miss a tiny segment.

o - Open curves really are open again.

Video Paint 231

o - Right click to paste while turning keeps any moves you might have made.
	(Side to side that is... rotation wasn't lost).

o - After a next blue you can hit undo to get rid of the blue.

o - Next changes doesn't copy last frame's color map into this one's.

o - Insert tween sets color map properly.  (Used to sometimes leave
    menu invisible and other problems when inserting between two
	frames with different color maps.)

o - Asterisk on use grid updated to reflect grid state after a 'make grid'.

o - Doesn't stop animation after about 3 minutes.  (Bug was introduced
    only in last version or two.)

o - Took out code for loading pictures except for .GIF and .PIC.

o - Used to take all but 16K of memory.  Now I take all but 4K.  Not
    really sure who if anyone would be using this memory.  May be tougher
	for a TSR to work with vpaint (as if it weren't already...) if it
	needed memory after activated by a hot key.  On the other hand
	most MS-DOS programs eat all memory on startup.

o - Chased around in dall() in auto.c to make use a little less memory.
    Think uncovered a problem with last version from not recompiling
	the world after changing the .flx structure a little.  Pretty
	vague.  Anyways time to trash all your settings and .flx files
	again...

Video Paint 230

o - Cut out file 'info' button.  Was about 500 bytes.  Decided not worth it.

o - Rearranged and renamed optics drop-downs a bit.

o - Changed 'ease in/ease out' to 'in slow/out slow' in time select to
    match optics.

o - Right clicking on left and right arrows of time slider brings up an
    offer to move back or forward so many frames.  (Especially useful for
	macros to every n'th frame).

o - Delete frame has a confirmation.

o - Right click over zoom to set level to 2 or 4.

o - Okok, optics moved to Vpaint pulldown.

o - Backwards (save fli backwards) put in Flics pulldown.


Video Paint 229

o - Spiral crash gone.

o - Implemented 'info' function in file menu.

o - Fixed 'range flip' and 'flip 5'

o - Curves in gradient modes work better.

o - Browse menu background color is better.

o - Cycle colors will refit screen if fit active.

o - Cut and paste work with all as well as cluster.

o - Use cel gets the first color right.

o - Blend in palette is implemented.

--- semantic changes ----

o - Thread renamed to gradients, spectrum to spectrums.

o - Cel/View --> Cel/Move.  Key equiv. is m

o - Cel/Mask --> Cel/1 Color.

o - Cel/Paste key equiv is `

o - Trace/Get Changes --> Trace/Clip Changes

o - Trace/Change Next --> Trace/Repeat Changes

o - Trace/Range Flip --> Trace/Segment Flip

o - 'ranges' in frames menu changed to 'segment'

o - separate close becomes separate near.

o - video/effects/dither becomes video/effects/lace

o - mask/free --> release

o - optics/render --> use

o - time-select/ok --> render


Video Paint 228

o - Quite possibly have fixed macros.

o - Removed a "vptemp.xxx" file left dangling after optics render in
    non-opaque ink to screen.

o - Gradient inks work better in optics and when turning and
    stretching cel.

o - Default 'ease in' is off.

o - Ease out is implemented, and ease in only effects 1st half of
    transform.  When ease in and ease out are both on it's like ease in
	used to be.

o - Got rid of a bug in multi-frame operations over segment that would
    in some cases paste the first frame of FLI onto your current frame.

Video Paint 227

o - Startup pen color is different (a light blue, color 250)

o - Added 'tween' option to curve and poly.  Also changed 'reuse' to
    be simpler.  Reuse just lets you change around the points and
	then paste the result (like reuse text basically...).  Tween
	brings up a little mini-menu.

o - Fixed some fairly horrific jaggies in fat lines introduced
    believe it or not as a side effect of having 'open' polygons.

o - The first end of a fat open polygon is rounded.

o - Toggling from fattest brush to skinny one in optics or time
    selector doesn't leave garbage on screen.

o - Two carraige returns don't crash text editor.  (This came in when
	I was doing the titling menu sometime...)

o - Use 64K of EMM for the undo buffer. 
	While I was testing this naturally I went back and forth between
	EMM disabled and enabled.  Turns out that the EMM driver uses
	almost exactly 64K.  This confused me no end thinking I was
	missing something.  Normally I run with EMM in though, so in
	fact I do get 64K more free space.  It's ironic I could have
	gotten same result on my machine just by taking the cemm line
	out of config.sys.  Anyhow it works.

Video Paint 226

o - Optic turn axis tilts the center glyph.

o - Size center is displayed instead of turn center when you're in
    size mode of optics.

o - Magic # of settings files gets updated properly when the settings
    file format is changed.

o - Optics path has open/closed button.  (This is a separate mode from
    the draw tools open/closed).

o - Optics path/spline has tension/continuity/bias sliders.  (Likewise
    separate from drawing curve t/c/b)

o - Changed all the words "Solid" to "Filled" in the drawing tools menu.

o - Added 'Closed' as a poly option.

o - Took 'reuse' out of some of the draw tools where it's not really
    functional (circle etc).

o - When editing polys or splines control points are fat.

o - Added 'still' motion type to Titling.  (For those times you
    don't want the titles to move at all.....)

Video Paint 225

o - Swapped Cel and Alt on the main drop-downs.

o - Box with menus up should be more aesthetic

o - Deleting 64K 'back frame buffer' file on program exit to make
    vpaint hog up a little less space on people's scratch disk.

o - Reworked Optics flat panel layout.

o - Implemented 'continue move'.  All moves are from the point of view
    of the thing being moved rather than the universe as before.

o - Had to change the state info in vvtemp.flx, so please get rid
    of your old default.flx and h:vvtemp.flx and .set (settings) files.

o - Axed 'first' stuff in optics pulldowns.  Also axed 'clear key'
    selection from pulldowns since it's on the flat menu.


Video Paint 224

o - Yes/No requestors and Continue alerts come up under mouse.  

o - File requestor comes up under mouse.

o - Reset added under New in Video.  New = old new/keep settings.
	Reset = old new/don't keep settings.

o - Effects and Optics reversed.

o - Renamed top line of menus.  Now it's Vpaint Flic Pic Alt Trace Cel Extra.

o - Changed 'Video' and 'animation' elsewhere in program to Flic.

o - Changed Macro to Record and .VPM to .REC.

o - Some more word rearranging in the pulldown.

o - Where possible made one-key keyboard equivalents visible on 
	drop-downs.

o - Added 'x' as a equiv for clear pic.

o - 'q' gives you the Yes/No query before exiting.

Video Paint 223

o - Numbered item menus come up under the mouse.
    So do the little number slider dialogs.

o - Changed the way right click over key color or 7 other inkwells works.
    It doesn't change you to that color automatically.

o - Stencil menu doesn't go away until you right click outside or select
    cancel.  Neither do grid or cel options.

o - Stencil changed to Mask and S to M.  The logic changed as we've talked.
    That is the parts of the mask you can see are the parts of the picture
	that are write-protected.

o - Stencil file type changed from .STE to .MSK.

o - A few more drop down menus changed.  The free xxx changed to release xxx.
    Blue and Cel swapped, etc.

o - Cel oriented coordinate displays don't take up full top line.

Video Paint 222

o - Right click on matrix copy color in.

o - Some drop-down names changed.

o - Paste works with inks.

o - Coordinate displays take out residual drop-down bs....

Video Paint 221

o - Right click cancels you out of paste.  

o - Paste works with the time selector.

o - Effects in multi-frame modes run out of memory less.

o - Took red flash out when run out of memory.

o - Fit is starting to mean something in the palette editor.

o - Pulldown/key equivs work in optics and palette.

o - Changed layout of Timing.


Video Paint 220

o - (After upload) Clicks inside cluster don't read the current color dots.

o - (After upload) Can get cluster the non-active cluster with a right click
    again.

o - New default palette.  

o - Browse looks better when color 0 isn't black.

o - Fill inkwell is more interactive.

o - Clicks to get color inside matrix don't read the grid color or current
    color dots.  (current color dots still read inside cluster though).


Video Paint 219

o - Changed Get Color key to F1 (conflict with 'Cel')

o - Changed startup-colors and inks.

o - Put in a new rev of the Palette.  The new layout is pretty much in, but
    "fit" is ignored and color fitting proceeds as it did before.  Haven't
	put in "blend" yet either, which I envision as a 'tweened' version of
	paste.  Don't want to tween the basic paste.

	I did 'line cluster' which is about as close to getting the cluster
	from an area of the screen as I want to get.  It's pretty fun though.
	Will stick 64 colors from under the line you draw into the active cluster.

	Palette/Menu Colors takes the interface colors to be the last 5 in
	the matrix.  Can't do a right click copy inside the matrix yet.

	Invert, reverse, and negative are all in.  All in all it's coming
	along.  Time to back up.

o - Tint works better than it used to when your color range was ping-ponged.

o - Going to palette from time select lets you have pull-downs in palette.

o - Right click in current color button in time select takes you to palette.

o - Don't know if I remembered to tell you - a few revs back I put in a
    right click over stencil toggle takes you to stencil choices.

o - Left click outside menu doesn't cancel the menu.  (This only occured
    in menus with drop downs on same screen).

o - Right click inside inks/tools doesnt cancel.

o - Found another Turbo C compiler switch that eliminates duplicate strings.
    Saved 400 bytes is all.

Video Paint 218

o - Automatic keyboard equiv's to 1st menu letters in.  (But not in
    optics or palette yet).  Not quite done with this yet, but it works.

o - System will temporarily usurp the last 5 colors in the palette if it
	can't find colors for interface.

o - Current color is outlined in red in the palette 256 color button.

o - System usurped colors if any (always last 5 if any at all) outlined
    in black.

o - Recompiled with an optimizing switch set on Turbo C.  Saved 2-3K in
    code size.

o - Ink button in Time Select is active.  Left click forces opaque.  Right
    click to Ink Types.


Video Paint 217

o - More browse changes.  The left column are radio buttons, not action
    buttons.  Got explicit ok to go with the cancel.  Fixed a few minor
	other browse bugs.

o - Multi-frame menu is transformed to Time Select.  The corresponding
    'M' buttons are changed to 'T'. 

o - Changed the time segment selector to be the same everywhere it
    appears (time menu, time select, and for now at least optics).
	It includes f/s/a buttons and the # of frames currently selected.

Video Paint 216

o - Reworking browse menu both layout and logic.  The 'current FLI'
	is pictured in the center of the menu (if it exists) along with
	it's name.  Clicking load/view/info/kill will start the action
	on the current FLI.  Single clicking on a shrunk FLI will make
	it the current FLI.  Double clicking will start the hilit action.

o - Hard carriage returns aren't visible when text is pasted.

Video Paint 215

o - Nuked double-draw browse menu bug and some of browse's out of
    memory stuff at same time.

o - Paste Below implemented.

o - Get changes implemented.

o - After successfully loading a cel it will appear for a second.

o - Close color threshold prompt comes after the color selection as in
    tint.

o - Initial browse action is load regardless of what it was when you
    last left browse.


Video Paint 214

o - Doing color operations over many frames should get out of memory
    and red flashing less often.

o - Made a change that reduces image tear.

o - Same change reduces 'color sparkle' when color cycling.  

o - Put back some code for word wrap took out of 213, but appears to
    be necessary after all.  

Video Paint 213

o - Added a little more error checking to font load.

o - Implemented other justifications in titling.

o - Fixed bug with space in text editor caused by justification.
    (After backup).

o - Fixed Xor text cursor being invisible in color 0.  (After backup)

o - Fixed Xor text cursor wrap around.  (After backup)


Video Paint 212

o - Changed default 'complete' to on.

o - Can use Lewis' Mac fonts.

o - Titling type on works.

o - Some internal changes to word wrap to make code a little smaller.

o - Changed titling a bit so that titles always end up scrolled off 
    all the way.

o - Added the frame count (aka Heidi Button) selection to suggest
    how many frames to do title over.


Video Paint 211

o - Fixed a bug in text editor that would let you move the cursor past
    the end of text downwards if you had more text than could fit in
	the window.

o - Useful part of titling is in there.  You can scroll up or across
    (across is single line only.)  Justification and type-on still
	to go.  This is fun stuff though!


Video Paint 210

o - Hit space and space to toggle menu and then can't get into
    palette or optics bug is gone.

o - Some internal changes to eliminate sdraw_menu from individual
    menu code and centralizing everything under draw_mp and hide_mp
	so can maintain a 'stack lock' to save hopefully a lot of
	little functions that are the same as other functions except
	for the presence or absence of draw_mp and hide_mp's.
	(Basically you shouldn't see this change unless I broke something.)

o - Put Titling as a systems drop-down option.  Now menu all works
    except for the 'DO TITLE' button.  (In other words all the non
	important stuff works!)

o - Bug where open path in optics followed by no motion and another open
    path and out of memory gone.

o - Time slider pastes changes on the correct frame now I hope.

o - Took out TJ's interrupt routine and substituted simpler one.
	(In hopes of eliminating a: b: bug on some systems).

o - 'Slow clock' in configure works again.

Please also check the various compositing wrong color bugs.  I think
they're all gone as of several versions back.

Ahh, last version I forgot about the new System pull-downs.  Also had a
look at the latest bug sheet and fixed all the easy ones.  (The hard ones
will probably generate new bugs with the fix 1/2 the time...)  Anyways
this is probably a good rev for the training session.  Titling soon to
come I hope.

o - Added Timing, Palette, Draw Tools, and Ink Types to System pull-down.  
	Moved Settings... to Other near Configure....

o - Fixed variable speed of clock depending on how mouse moved in
	clocked paths.

o - Fixed turns slider creep towards zero when turns negative in optics.

o - In optics/Size increasing size with mouse doesnt lead to numbers
    greater than 100 on your reduce slider.  Moves enlarge instead.

o - Wierdness with stretch with non-opaque inks and stencil nuked.

o - Click on Browse/Path doesn't do anything (used change path to
    last path and draw the path selection in the normal file selector
	- display garbage basically ).

o - Clear track in optics/Size does clear center.

o - Neither stretch nor rotate move your cel position.

o - Color undo updates rgb/hls sliders.

o - Color restore updates rgb/hls sliders.

Video Paint 207

o - Made another stab at nuking the a: b: crash/hang on browse and file
    requestor.  Let me know how it works for you.  Should change you
	to your startup directory if no disk in drive.

o - Composite menu includes what ink type you're in.  Ie "Overlay Scrape".

o - Time slider doesn't lose changes to this frame.

o - Right click (as well as left click) lets you set # of frames in time
    menu.

o - Right click to abort mouse setting during optics doesnt leave
    pasted center.

o - Fixed Separate range.

o - Paste Stencil and Paste Grid work better in horizontal and vertical grad.

o - Separate range renamed to separate cluster.

o - Range/cluster renamed to a, b.

o - Reworked optics x/y spin/turn axis.

Video Paint 206

o - Cycle palette works.

o - Swapped undo and restore positions in palette.

o - Palette restore works like elsewhere - restores everything since you've
    entered that frame.

o - Palette/color/files... no longer pops you out of palette.

o - No Fitting option in composite doesn't fit.  (Well it still does
   during underlay.  Sue me.  A little hard to fix that.)

o - Color fitting works for Cel stretch and rotate.

o - Cross-fade color fitting should work better when not using current...

o - Paste grid uses ink.

o - In optics menu with non-opaque ink should no longer get 'not a pic file'
    messages during previews you abort.

o - Multiframe preview works better with pack and other color options.


Video Paint 205

o - Eliminated To Amiga and To ST options for pack.

o - (After backup before download)Started implementing cycle draw.

o - Pack, sort, threads, spectrums work on cluster as well as all.

Video Paint 204

o - Swap cluster is in there.

o - Swap color remaps picture to look the same.

o - Ping Pong cluster works.

o - HLS button works.

o - Made palette color sliders save undo and if necessary redraw the menu.
	(If you're changing a menu color.)

o - Made Use Cel and Default go in cluster mode.

Video Paint 203

o - Most of palette pull-down system now working.  In particular tint works
    multi-frame and can be used for color fade-ins and fade-outs.
	Tint is sensitive to whether done to cluster or to all.  The other
	remaps are all to all right now.

o - The ramp is effectively just a second cluster right now. 

o - Ran sluff over source code to find unused junk (about 2K).

Video Paint 202

o - In palette current color box is used to display what color you're
    over when copying color, setting range, or finding ramp for cluster.

o - Put undo under color pull-down in palette.

o - Color swap works (just 1 color at a time).

o - Bad end cookie (as well as start cookies) pops you back to right resolution.

o - Cluster cut works. (with range paste).

o - Cluster Closest Colors works.

o - Cluster Unused Colors works.

o - Cluster Force Ramp works.

Thinking it over simply by allowing a Cluster select that was like ramp
select now would make the Cluster able to do everything the ramp does.
I think to save code space I'm going to drop the ramp completely and have
two clusters.  Anyways always good to backup before you start cutting things
out.


Video Paint 201

o - Colors in range or cluster are surrounded by a white box in palette
    grid.

o - New color pull-downs installed.  Not much of the 'new' stuff works
    yet in it, but the old stuff is already reconnected.

Video Paint 200

o - (After v200 upload but before backup) fixed number requestor crashes
    in splice and repeat macro.

o - Starting work on Palette again.  Main change is the color cluster.
	Right click on this to set it.  Pick two end-points, and it'll try
	to get a spectrum in the current color palette between those
	endpoints.  This is not the last word in defining a cluster, but
	was one of the functions you were asking for any ways.  

o - Please destroy default.flx and vvtemp.flx files from old versions
    when running this version.  Sorry to keep making you do this.  Also
	your old settings files are apt to not load.

o - Boxed separate missed the last line on the right. Fixed this.

o - Ink wells are correctly hilit after a right click to fill an ink
    well.
