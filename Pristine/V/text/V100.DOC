o - Separate now lets you do a rgb type color separate rather than
    by color index.  Hit 'rgb' on the tool options menu when sep is
	selected.  The threshold controls how close colors have to be to
	the color(s) you've pen downed over before they're separated to
	the current color.  Separate from the pull-down uses whatever option
	you've selected from the tools menu.  Default is rgb on, 10% threshold.
	When in rgb mode the destination color is also color fitted frame
	by frame.  

o - Fixed a couple of places where the file requestor wouldn't show
    up in recognizable colors.

o - Fixed a bug in zoom logic that had a number of symptoms including:
		1. Separate from pulldown didn't work in zoom mode.
		2. A cancel response to 'over how many frames' requestor in
		   zoom mode would act like a 'to this frame' response.

o - Converted to Turbo C 2.0.  It demanded a few changes to the source
    code 'cause it's even more strict about syntax than 1.5, but no
	changes that should make any difference to program behavior.
	Code size did grow about 1.2K.  Hope it didn't put in any other
	bugs.  Peeling off another version here just to aid in debugging
	in case some new bugs came in with the compiler.

o - Stretch doesn't snap the center of Cel to cursor position when
    you move it.  

o - Rotate changed so that logic is the same as Stretch.

o - Bogus 'cut' cursor left on picture when you hit escape twice is gone.

o - When you right-click over a tool to get to the tool options menu,
	the current tool is the one you right-clicked over, and it's
	hilit properly.


Video Paint 147

o - Stretch now lets you move the Cel around after it's been flipped.

o - Rotate and stretch now respond to key color.

o - Can move cel off screen to right during stretch without it wrapping
    around on other side.

o - Found a memory trashing bug (hope it's the only one!) in the 
    low level raster stretcher/rotater.  Pretty sure this was the big one.
	The symptoms we were getting are pretty much explained by it and
	it hasn't crashed since.  Yea!!!

o - Added Cel/Options which lets you set whether there is a key color.
    Also has another 'fit colors' option which is currently ignored.

o - Made 'quick choice' menus so they don't move to fix a few bugs.

o - The a: b: confusion in browse is nuked.


Video Paint 146

o - Added twirl and whirl to auto menu.  Shades of ADO.

o - Fixed bug when delete frames so that no longer have current frame,
	sytem not confused.

o - Sped up insertion of frames.

o - Fixed a bug when creating more than 300 frames.

This one is overlayed.

Video Paint 145

o - Fixed bug where would grab grey if you selected the border of a
    ink box.

o - Fixed some bugs in zoom with paste, rotate, stretch.

o - Added 'info' to browse.

o - Added 'fit colors' to cel transforms.

o - Switched stretch to use the same routine as rotate.  Some interesting
    side effects.  You can now use stretch to mirror an image.

o - Fixed Cel Tile bug where pattern would break at upper left corner 
    of cel.

o - Sped up non-dithered case of Cel Tile quite a bit.

There's still a memory trashing bug somewhere in raster rotate.  (Now in
stretch too, whoopie!)  Damn if I can get it to reproduce!  Seems to
happen almost the 1st time you do it or not at all. ?????

This version isn't overlayed.  Tlink is so much faster than plink just got
lazy is all.

Video Paint 144

o - Machine coded rotate routine.  About 3x faster than it used to be.
    Wow!

Video Paint 143

o - Rotates seem to no longer crash.  

o - Browse bug for zoe.gif (and other 1st frames that are stored
    uncompressed) fixed.

Video Paint 142

o - Raster 2-D rotate mostly working.  Select cel/transform after you've
    cut out something.  A full screen will appear.  There's no 'where's the
	cursor' logic, it just rotates around z regardless of where you pendown.
	Pendown again to set.  Sometimes you'll get a bad cookie doing your
	next cut or load after this.  (Still trashing memory somewhere, though
	1 less place than last rev.)

Video Paint 141

o - Started work on raster rotate.  Going a little faster than I'd 
    figured.  Got something that rotates a cel slowly through 360
	degrees.  Aliasing and speed are about like Cyber Paint for all
	I can tell, maybe faster.  Still trashes memory somewhere and
	no user interface.


Video Paint 140

o - fixed load custom font and crash bug introduced last version.

o - Can stretch a cel.  Pick cel/transform form pulldowns.  (Later this
    might lead to a little menu where you can pick rotate, flip, etc
	as well.
	Main peculiarity is when Cel would stretch to be bigger than 64K
	it snaps back to original size.  (It may stay this way.  Fair amount
	of coding to fix it.)

Video Paint 139

o - Going to the Pheonix linker and doing some overlays.  Fairly massive
    reorganization of code (just moving things from file to file) to
	better accomodate overlays.  Right now have about 32K more free
	memory than before started overlays.  


Video Paint 138

o - Seem to be able to delete frames ok now.

o - Made spacing of 'numbered choices' types menu a little bigger.


Video Paint 137

o - 8 point stars from corner to corner goes 'oops too big' instead of
    bad cookie.

o - View on browse is now implemented.  It's been moved under 'load' 
    which is the default action.

o - Trials not on 1st frame bug fixed.  Trials always does 'to all'.

o - Installed a mini menu tree when you right click over the frame #.
    Delete still isn't working, nor 'total frames' when it's less than
	the current.  However can now insert any # of frames anywhere in
	animation.

Video Paint 136

o - Cut out most of browse that I decided be too strange to implement.
    The directory stuff is working.   Menu is extremely ugly right now.

o - Put in 'trails' on auto drop down.  Useless except in to all mode
    when on first frame to start.  Still a very pretty and useful effect
	we'll have to explore some more.


Video Paint 135

o - Browse pretty much works except for the
    'change dir' sort of stuff.  Click on load/save/kill to select
	function.  Click over a picture/name to perform action on that file.
	Click on exit or right click over picture area to cancel.


Video Paint 134

o - Started on browse.  


Video Paint 133

o - Moved dither option to all inks where it's relevent.  (May not
    all seem real relavent to you though.)

o - Put in Fade Out, Venetian, Dissolve, and Circle Wipe into 
    splice/transitions menu. 

o - Multi-frame stuff is closer to happening.  To segment in though
    right now no way to change segment away from 4-12 the default.

	Hilite the small 'M' many frame box.  Then whenever you do something
	that can apply to many frames a requestor will come up asking
	you whether to do it to all, to segment, etc.

o - axed a bug in text editor that would cause a 'adding a line'
    requestor to come up 2nd time using text if cursor was
	not on 1st line when exited text 1st time.


Video Paint 132

o - Put in an error correcting dither on most true-color functions.
    This includes transparent, scrape, soften, darken, brighten.
	It's activated by the dither button on the radial spreads.
	It's really a different dither and is sort of experimental.
	It's fun to use with cross-fade, but generates 50K deltas.

o - Splice functional.  No spatial offset and no transition beyond
    a straight cut yet.  You can splice at the beginning or the end.

o - Fixed bad screen when in overlay combine color and say to
    'chop at end'.

o - Sped up combine color when colors aren't changing from frame to frame.

o - Transition menu in splice lets you do a whipe.  Colors are blended
    in the transition frames.

Video Paint 131

o - Overlays a little more debugged.

o - Splice almost functional.  Works, but when you quit the program
    somehow the 2nd half of the splice gets lost....

o - Bunch of new options for transparent overlay, including the
    'cross fade' that got lost when my hard disk lunched.


Video Paint 130

o - Overlays a little more debugged.  Splice a little further along (but
    still not functional).

o - Configuration stuff should 'stick' when you're not in your
    launch directory.

o - Keeping track of the font directory more reliably

Arrg.  Just had part of my drive with sources lunched.  Lost some work
since last back up.   Only about 2 hours work if I can remember what it
was.


Video Paint 129

o - Overlays now will give you a choice of 3 ways of fitting colors if
    the color palette of the 2 FLI's isn't the same.  You can
	1. combine palettes.    2. use current palette.  3. use overlay palette.
	There's a bug in the combine palette ones which causes some of
	the colors generated to have off-scale RGB values.  Pretty sure
	it's same bug as in pack colors in color menu.

o - Underlay works a lot better.  Still problems with clear color here and
    in other overlays.


Video Paint 128

o - Have 3 types of overlays with some degree of functionality:  over,
	under, and transparent.  Over and transparent work pretty much as
	you'd expect.  Over is hard wired for color 0 clear (gumbi style). 
	Transparent will treat ink well 0 as clear (Vpaint style).
	Under screws up the color map 2 ways.  It's main saving grace is
	not crashing.

o - Splice leads to a small choice menu, but it's not further implemented.

Video Paint 127

o - Started on video overlays.


Video Paint 126

o - Text tool is pretty much there features wise.  Still a few
    niggly bugs.


Video Paint 125

o - Text tool is mostly re-implemented.  First you define text window
    and then you type in it.  Pendown inside window lets you move
	window around.  Right click deposits text permanantly.  Some
	interesting variations on this inside the text tool option area.
	Use 'place' if you want to re-use old text or text you've just
	loaded.

	Hopefully soon while your editing a pendown outside the window will
	let you redefine the window.

	There's still a few places I'm off by one, and some really wierd
	but non-fatal bugs I've encountered in the text editor.  Sometimes
	the portion of text displayed changes when you move the window or
	place it.


Video Paint 124

o - Hilighting on quick menu is different.


Including some layouts for quick menu with less ink types.  

Video Paint 123

o - Added Move drawing tool.

o - Frame/Separate will do a 'to all'.

o - You see your brush when in a pentool that uses brush.  (Almost anything
    not filled for instance) when not in menu.

o - Lines are now rounded at both ends if using a brush.


Video Paint 122

o - Drop down menus undrop when you move outside of them.

o - Cursor is bigger when you're in zoom mode and over picture.

o - Rearranging hi-level program control flow.  Making 'pen-tool' routines
    keep control until you move into a menu.  (Like Ani as opposed to
	Cyber Paint.)  This will make it easier to blow up the cursor during
	zoom while still having it normal size and scale over menus etc.  Also
	make it so each pen-tool can have it's own cursor (for fill, and 
	doing a brush cursor for tools that use a brush.)  Finally should be
	easier to do a 'text-tool' this way.  (Can use the undo buffer for
	behind the text...)

Video Paint 121

o - Converted last old slider (ink strength) and pulled out old slider code.
	(New sliders use 1 button for slider and arrows.)

o - Put in the automatic 1 of up to 8 choice menu code.  Using it now
    in the Configuration stuff.  (You can make choices with the mouse
	too and it looks a little nicer.)  


Video Paint 120

o - Rearranged memory management some.  Will sometimes attempt to temporarily
    swap out zoom, alt screen, mask screen, and cel if low on memory and
	trying to recompress.
o - Fixed a 64 byte memory leak in file requestor (only happened if 
    inside a sub-directory).
o - Fixed a 32 byte memory leak in alloc_screen() (which is called often.)
o - Closed is a curve option.  (But open doesn't really work yet.)



Vide Paint 119

o - File Menu and Drawing tools in legible colors and generally usable if
    not if final form.

o - Tom Jeffries interrupt routine yanked so would work on Eric's machine.



Video Paint 118

o - Redid Draw Tools menu to go with new colors.  Also Brush Width and
    Play Speed mini-menus.

o - Reworked my Slider routine so as to take only one menu entry per slider
    instead of 4.

o - Moved around a bunch of stuff in drop-downs by 1.

o - Video Titler greyed out.


Video Paint 117

o - Move a bunch of boxes in the Quick Menu by 1.

o - Implemented all the keyboard equivalents in the drop-downs.

o - Deimplemented 'M' for move.  (Which is now position and has no
    key equiv.

Video Paint 116

o - Got Quick Menu, Continue and Yes/No boxes, and drop-downs in new 
    menu format/color scheme.

Video Paint 115

o - Changed menu font to sixhi font.

Video Paint 114

o - Took out DOS button.

o - Made Clear top of Frame drop-down.  What was Clear is now Set.

o - Spin-stars start out small and grow.

o - 'U' key goes through and swaps out everything it can think of to disk,
	frees memory, and loads it back up again in an attempt to Unfrag memory.
	(It works sometimes too.)


Video Paint 113

o - Have a DOS button on the file requestor.  Lets you execute a command
    shell.

o - Saving a copy of current frame on exit so don't have to do big tseek on
    startup.

Video Paint 112

o - Curve tool (spline) is in.  Modified Tom's routine a lot.
    Starting to like it....


Video Paint 111

o - Working in splines.  Currently an outline spline is drawn on in red top of
    any polygon.  (Just for debugging).

o - Clear is now equavalent to a full screen box in current color.  It
    looks at ink type.  It also lets you do it over all.  (Shades of
	pixel f/x menu...).


Video Paint 110

o - Added in path cel and auto/spinstar.


Video Paint 109

o - You see cel position and movement when doing a Cel/Move or Cel/Paste.

o - Can now create more than 256 frame animations. (Up to 4K I hope!)

o - Status box changed to include size of frame updates.


Video Paint 108

o - Right click over single right arrow (go forward a frame) and you can
    type in a frame number to jump to.

o - Right click over the frame number and you get to set how many frames in
    animation.  (Right now doesn't do anything if you set for less frames
	than are actually there.)

o - Frame number in quick menu goes from 1 to 16 (or whatever) instead of
    from 0 to 15


Video Paint 107

o - Finally got my fat line routine up to snuff.  (I had to do an endpoint
    lookup table.  Will be more work if ever need lines bigger than 11 wide.)


Video Paint 106

o - Brushes are rounder and generally nicer.  Still at least one jag to
    nuke in even (or is it odd?) brush sizes, but it's getting pretty close.
	Brush width back to normal.  Brushes up through brush 3 are probably
	in final shape.

Video Paint 105

o - Brushes are round again.  Still a ways to go with this I'm afraid.
    My line draw routine makes assymetrical jaggies when using it to connect 
	points spaced evenly around a circle. This causes some jags that could 
	look better with certain brush widths.  Also the brush width is 2x as
	big as it should be while I figure out a way to do even brush widths.
	Aaarrggh.   Oh well, it should be fun playing around with some very
	fat brushes in the meantime.  The speed is good if nothing else.

o - Solid toggle works on boxes.

o - Macros work with spiral.


Video Paint 104

o - Overwrite existing file warning.

o - Keyboard z for zoom command.

o - Drizzle reacts to pen width.


Video Paint 103

o - Using Tom Jeffries fake vblank routines.  It's an improvement though
    not a real dramatic one.   I'm hoping to find a vertical video
	beam position register somewhere that will let me do beam chasing.
	(The new vblank routine was necessary but not sufficient for this.)
	In the meantime things rip a little less already.

Video Paint 102

o - More zoom debugging.

o - Video Titler is about where it was before I let menus be on screen.
    That is to say it basically works, but has some cosmetic bugs,
	no undo, and is very wierd in zoom.   

o - Options on pulldowns that aren't available are greyed out.


Video Paint 101

o - Odd boundary zooms work ok.

o - Eliminated mouse_x and mouse_y variables.

o - Fixed top area mess during box tool.

o - Color separate works with menu up.


Video Paint 100

o - Getting zoom closer to finished.  It's much faster now than it ever
    was.  Cursor now longer gets magnified though.  Also menus on odd
	boundary still lose a line.
