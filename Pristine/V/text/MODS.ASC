VPAINT MODIFICATIONS (2/7/89)

Jim:  All this stuff is in alphabetical order and has yet to be
prioritized.  Gary and I will be doing that tomorrow.  Note that
there are three parts to this.  The first part is modifications,
the second part is semantics, and the third part is drop-down
organization.  The drop-down changes are related to the semantics
and are an attempt to eliminate duplicate init-letters for the
keyboard alternate scheme.  (And in some cases, to shorten the
menus, and reorganize according to usage and function.)

MODIFICATIONS

3-D F/X: Ripple & Buzz -- both directions, if possible.

Blue: Get Changes needs to be implemented.

Browse: Browse selection should be double-click, both to be
consistent with the file menus, and to avoid accidentally loading
a FLI and wiping out memory.  Also should allow a single-click
which outlines the border, then click on OK to load.

Browse: Info, View, and Kill should not change the filename
currently in the file selector.

Browse: The Load button should always be on whenever the Browse
menu appears (instead of hanging on to the last choice).  Right
now, it's too easy to Kill a file from Browse, go on to something
else, then return to Browse, select a file, and forget that you'd
previously set it to Kill.

Brush: Brush Shapes & Get Brush.

Cel Mask: Make this a mode and put it in the Options... menu. 
This will both shorten the Cel drop-down and make Mask Cel non-
destructive.  (It will also leave the letter 'M' available for
'Move Cel.'

Cel Get, Separate Box, & Crop: Use optional poly lasso.

Cel: Paste Below needs to be implemented.

Cel: Paste Below.

Cel/Alt menus:  Confusion is still there (feedback from AD
users).  Place the Alt menu to the right of the Blue menu.

Color: Close Color threshold prompt should come _after_ the color
selection (consistent with Tint).

Color: Invert Cluster -- makes a cluster of all colors not in the
cluster, and removes the cluster boxes from all colors which are
in the cluster.

Color: Remapping is inconsistent.  User needs to know when a
function will remap the screen and when it won't.

Color: Need larger selected-color-slot indicator in Palette
Editor. (Either bigger quadruple pixels or something different.)

Color: A post-processing palette filter that goes through all
disparate palettes and fits them to avoid flicker during
playback.  (A color version of All Greys.)

Color: Grab Cluster (using a box) from screen.

Color: A way to apply cumulative color changes over a range of
frames before exiting the Palette Editor (a la Gumby).

Color: Cycle Palette actually works on the active cluster and
ignores the Cluster/Palette mode settings.

Color: The new color selection mode, which dynamically shows the
color under the cursor, should be used for any case of color
selection (such as when you right-click on a color in the Mini-
palette).

Color: Any way to shift the highlight in a ping-ponged cluster?

Color: Negative Colors (a la Gumby's Invert)

Color: Flip cluster, reverses direction of colors in cluster.

Composite: Key Color works fine with Underlay/Keep Current Color. 
We need some way to let the user know the active key color for
both resident and incoming files, and to manipulate it for the
various compositing operations.  Also need to maintain a
consistent Key Color on the various composites.

Composite: A way to combine colors on anim. merges without
shuffling the two palettes. (Maintain them as two blocks.)

Composite: Apply Optics settings to the positioning of the
incoming fli.

Compositing: Over and Underlay GIFs over range of frames.

Dialogs: Any of the numeric-list dialogs containing multiple-
choice asterisked modes (Grid, Stencil, etc.) need OK/Cancel
buttons to exit.  They should stay on screen until the user
chooses to exit.

Dialogs: Like-type dialogs should line up in same position on
screen (try the New [Yes][No] dialogs for example).

Disk I/O and Filename handling.  Files and paths should be
maintained for the various file types.  Also, on a new save,
there should be no default filename in the filename field (this
would have prevented the problem that happened in the training
session.)

Display: It would be nice to get rid of more of the playback
tear. (This might be saved for the US Video card.)

Display: Toggle cursor coordinate display on or off, and/or
toggle coordinate position on screen.

Effects: Some of these are inconsistent:
     Shrinkx2: Place shrunken image at Zoom window location.
     Trails: Should work according to multi-frame settings.
     Number: Should work according to multi-frame settings. 
     (Would be nice to choose between absolute and relative
     numbering.)
     Pixelate: If set to 1x1, should not take the time to do it.
     Engrave: Want to set direction of engraving.

Effects: Allow numeric input on Shrinkx and Expandx (like Shrinkx
2, or 3, or 4, etc.).

Flip Range: Loop thru range until key-click.  (If this isn't
possible, how about with Flip 5 where you know the limit of the
number of frames?)

Frame: What is the purpose of View Frame?

GIF conversion: Need a separate file-conversion utility for GIF
(like cropper) which lets you choose between compressing the
aspect ratio, or windowing to select the portion of the picture
you want.  Should also convert such image types as Deluxe Paint,
Splash, Color Rix, etc.

Inks: Dither strength adjustment.

Inks: Monochrome Emboss  -- emboss everything down to the Active
Color and a lighter and darker shade of it.  (Gary says this is
not a priority!)

Inks: Emboss direction (compass rose).

Inks: Edge In.

Inks: A true Brighten.

Inks: Gradient direction control (compass rose).

Keyboard Alternates.

Mask: Show Mask should use a neutral color that will always
display, like menu red.

Numeric sliders: A zeroing function.

Optics: Layout is confusing at present.  When user first enters
the Optics screen, they should see that:

     1)   They can affect one of four graphic elements: Screen,
          Cel, Poly, Curve.
     2)   They can set one of four basic types of motion: Spin,
          Size, Movement, and Path.
     3)   They can set the motion with the mouse, after clicking
          on axis constraint buttons.  Secondarily, if the mouse
          isn't accurate enough for them, they can use sliders
          for exact motion.

Optics: Path/Spline, etc.  These need their own spline and
shouldn't use the Curve Tool's Open/Close parameters.

Optics: Path/Spline, etc.  The drawn spline should use menu red.

Optics: Size -- It's confusing to have the two different forms of
X/Y in the Size section.  One set of buttons labels the effect of
the sliders, and the other set uses a similar, but different,
system to constrain the mouse effect.  Maybe this will be clearer
after the menu is rearranged.

Optics: Put 'First' and 'Move to First' on the flat menu.

Optics: Coordinate readouts on mouser actions.

Optics: Ease-Out in addition to Ease-In.

Projector: Need a public domain projector program to view FLI's
and GIF's.  Ideally, would include a simpified batch-scripting
system that would let the user line up all the stuff on a hard
disk and play through a list, adjusting the playback speed of
each animation, and the display time of each picture, including
optional keypress to go to next file.  Also should include
keyboard lock-out, etc.  (Gary and I will spek this out next
week.)

Quit: [Q] keyboard alternate should be consistent with the Quit
drop-down selection (including the alert).

Restore: Should Restore consider Swap Alt a change?  (The more I
think about it, the more I think it should. -- JP)

Segment Range Bar: This should look the same wherever it appears,
and the Range buttons (though not the Mark buttons), should
always be part of it.

Segment Range Bar: Reverse the right-click/left-clicks on
adjusting the bar.

Segment Range Bar: Save Range (and save reverse).

Splice: At least ten additional transition effects.

Splice: Lap Dissolve

Stretch/Rotate: Need coordinate readouts.

Text: Text effects -- outline, italics, etc.

Time Menu: The Insert and Delete frames icons should be isolated
and separate from the movement icons. (Or, maybe they should
explicitly say 'Insert' and 'Delete.'  At the same time, the
design and layout of the Time Control Icons in the Time Menu
should appear as an expansion of the same icons on the Fast Menu
and elsewhere.

Time: Automatically create a reversed set of frames in memory to
simulate ping-pong.  (Or save reverse to disk.)

Tools: Bubbles & Rays.

Tools: Adjust Circle aspect. (Bob B. said there were problems
with Circles on some VGA boards.)

Tools: Line tool needs a K-line option. (Or better handled by
Open Poly.) (Would be nice to include Connect and Concentric
buttons among the Tools parameters.)

Tools: Edge In

Tools: Poly [Open] button.

Tools/Inks: Discrete Tool/Ink parameter settings.  

Video: Merge -- Loads and insert an animation immediately after
the current frame (like insert frames in the Time menu).

Zoom: More levels.

SEMANTICS

Blue Numbers: Change to Number Frames.  (Or, if we keep Blue
Numbers, put it in the Blue menu.)

Blue: Change 'Flip Range' to 'Range Flip'

Blue: Change 'Get Changes' to 'Clip Changes.'

Blue: Change 'Insert Tween' to 'Inbetween' (actual animator's
term, won't be confused with computer-style tweening.)

Blue: Change 'Flip 5' to 'Five Flip'

Blue: Change 'Blue' drop-down title to 'Trace' (describes more of
the functions, really).

Blue: Change Next Changes to ???

Cel: Change Get to ???

Close Ink: Change to Bridge, Link, Join...

Close Separate & Color: Change to 'Near.'

Color: 'Color' drop-down only makes sense for Copy & Swap
functions.???

Dialogs: All dialogs should use the same terms for [OK] [Cancel]. 
All alerts should use [OK].

Dither: Change to Lace, Granulate, (so it doesn't conflict with
the Ink parameter).

Frame/Set: Change 'Set' to 'Apply Ink.'

Free: Change to non-F word (keyboard conflict with Files...). 
Possibly 'Release.'

Inks/Semantics: Dialog that now contains: 1. Transparent, 2. Zero
Clear, 3. Ink 0 Clear, 0. Cancel; should be changed to: 1. Use
Ink, 2. Key Color Clear, 3. Register 0 Clear, 0. Cancel.  (CAN WE
GET BY WITH ONLY KEY-COLOR AND DROP REGISTER ZERO ALL TOGETHER?)

Key Color button on Fast Menu to [K].

Kill: Change to Erase or Delete.

Macros: Put on Frame drop-down to avoid alph conflict with Mask,
and it makes more sense here anyway.

Move Tool: Change to Tweak, Shift, or Adjust.

Multi-Frame: Use icon for button.

Multi-Frame: Change [Use] to [Render].

Other: Definitely need something for this menu???

Optics:  Change to 3D F/X.

Optics: Change 'Ease In' to 'In Slow'

Optics: Change 'Ease Out' to 'Out Slow'

Separate: Change to ???

Solid/Filled: Keep [Solid] button, change [F] button on fast menu
to [S] (Stencil becomes [M]ask; Multi-frame becomes an icon).

Stencil/Mask: Change 'Stencil' to 'Mask.'  Use an icon for Multi-
Frame button.  Masking should work opposite of the way it does
now: the part you draw on to create the mask is the part that is
blocked (masked) from subsequent ink application.

Tools: Change 'Curve' to 'Spline'

Translate Cel: Change to Move Cel.
