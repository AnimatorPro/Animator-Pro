PJ115
	o - Worked around a problem in 3D Studio REX loader for
	    Vibrant - a FlicLib client - by initializing
		static Rastlibs to zero during run time.  (3DS
		loader initialized static data to FE instead of
		zero. Joy!)
PJ114
    o - Ian fixed a few bugs in vesa driver under DOS4g.
	o - Code delivered to Autodesk.

PJ113 (Shipped as Ani Pro 1.3a)
	o - Zoom window updates after unzagged text is rendered.
	o - Got together with Ian and fixed flclib for non-Phar Lap
		DOS extenders.  Was three fixes actually - two of Ian's
		in the VESA code, and one of mine where a change to
		pj_key_is() a while back broke things.

PJ112 9/23/93
	o - Fixed bug in fliclib that made 3D Studio crash playing back
		a 256x243 file "problem.flc" that included an uncompressable
		frame.  The problem ended up being that the _pj_copy_rectpix()
		call was unclipped, even in a Clipbox raster.  I fixed this
		by clipping the generic version of pj_copy_rectpix,  and 
		forcing the safecbox raster library to use the generic for
		this routine.
			Note: It turns out that the new flclib21 generated with
			this build only works in the Phar Lap version, not the
			Watcom.  This is fine for Ani Pro and 3DS, but not for
			some of our flclib customers.  I think it actually broke
			back at flclib20, but need to consult with Ian Lepore
			about this.

	o - As per Robert W. Moote's suggestion I changed the DPMI
		detect logic of Ani Pro to make it compatible with 386MAX.
		All I've been able to test is that it still works without DPMI
		and under Windows.  Someone please verify the fix under
		386MAX.  (New function in util/dpmiutil.asm.  Call to this
		function in util/trdmemlo.asm.)

PJ111 7/13/93
	o - Rearranged code a little so player and convert programs would
		link.  (Type1.c work had broken their link.)

PJ110 7/8/93
	o - Changed a "char a[4]" to "unsigned char a[4]" in type1.c 
	    per Josh Gordon's help.
	o - .PFB fonts start with 1 intercharacter spacing by default 
		instead of 0.
	o - Starting to implement oversampling of .PFB fonts.  There's
		a new button - "unzag" - that shows up on the font requestor
		when a .PFB font is selected.  By default it is selected.
		When unzag is on the fonts are antialiased via oversampling
		when they are rendered.  It will not be apparent when you are
		editing text,  but once you plant it you'll see the softer edges.

PJ109
	o - Fixed bug 55887.  Tabs work in .pfb fonts.
	o - Did a fix to the pfb font offsets that seems to have
		remedied #55890 and 55891.
 	o - 55892, the Edge tool using the current brush - is a feature.
	o - Loading incorrect filetype for polygon gives an error message.
		Text files don't give error messages on purpose.  Basically
		any file can be treated as a text file, and that's ok.
		(Bug 55889).

PJ108 
	o - DOS shell has 256K available instead of 64K. (57018)
	o - Changed PFB font rendering just a trifle so that floating
		point rounding less likely to lead to flat-bottomed o's and
		c's. (55853).
 	o - Fixed bug 93266 - Optics Panel after a cel is released crash.

PJ107 (4/9/93)
	o - No mouse input driver works again.
	o - Fixed bug where C: button in file menu not responsive to mouse
		input if you have more than 2 rows of drives.
	o - Added JPEG PDR.
	o - Fixed bug in Anim.pdr where it wasn't handling empty plane dlta's
		ok. (Mark D'Aquin's problem.)  Changed line 384 of anim.c.

PJ106 (3/1/93)
	o - Fixed detail in "seac" command to make accents no longer shifted
	    horizontally in some .pfb fonts.
	o - Changed code that checks if keyboard is ready to look at 040:001A
		and 040:001C instead of doing BIOS call on Christer's advice.
		Seems to fix problem program had with <control>break's when in
		text editing mode.

PJ105 (2/12/93)
	o - Updated convert and player programs to avoid Window's performance
	    problems.
	o - Made Adobe .pfb fonts work with European charactes.  Fix was
	    to implement the "seac" opcode in the type1 interpreter.

PJ104 (1/29/93) -
    o - Put back in straight 4.1 Phar Lap (not ACAD version) to fix
	    some performance problems under Windows.
	o - Fixed things so that eur_____.pfb and euro____.pfb fonts load
	    and are mapped to code page 850 (multilingual) as per Norwegian
		requests.

PJ103 -
	o - Encorperated Autodesk's changes to the player about box in aa.mu.
	o - Updated \build\flitape and \build\pixelpop to reflect what is 
		actually shipping.  (\build\flipaper is still out of date though.)
	o - Backed it up!

PJ102 - Shipping version pretty much of 1.3.  Some changes to aa.mu done
at Autodesk.
	o - Changed "about" box in player to go through aa.mu again.
	o - Added .bmp to list of picture types on convert pull-down.
	o - 52152 NAB.  This invokes the color cycling feature
	    (which like the optics panel is always done over time.)
	o - 55821 fixed.  Safe titling Flush Right ok.
	o - 55835 fixed.  (same fix as #55821 internally actually.)
	o - 55883 NAB.  Phil DeGeorge at least says this is a known bug in
		the Model 95 Video BIOS.  Other programs using 320x200 256 color
		display modes also have problems on that machine.
	o - 55884.  Not Fixed.   Couldn't figure out how to do this and
		keep it looking good in the *normal* case where you haven't
		set the leading to something absurd.
	o - 57013. Fixed.  Period is gone.

PJ101
    o - 52150 NAB.  True the brush size can be 1 at the home panel
        while showing 5 at the brush menu.  However if you toggle the
        brush from the home panel it will go to whatever it says in the
        brush menu.   Since one size is always '1' and the other is
        something else,  we don't show the '1' size.
    o - I'm going to classify the following as problems with the fonts
        themselves and not try to code around them:
        55856, 55858, 55859, 55867.
    o - 55875 fixed. Used "QmenuWithFlags" to put asterisks in appropriate 
        places of Show'em Set Output Style menu to fix this one in PJ99 
        actually.
    o - 55876 was fixed a while back.  Just double checked and it's still
        fixed.
    o - 55877 fixed.  It's called 'info' now.
    o - 55879 NAB.  Some of 3-D Studio's font types are unknown to Ani Pro.
    o - 55882 fixed.  Background images in show'em under safe titling
        are in same color map as without safe titling.
    o - 56720 NAB.  Wouldn't be practical to do this in a multi-frame
        setting.
    o - 56721 fixed.  RND files are unflipped.
    o - 57005 fixed.  Added "Press" to "any key ..."
    o - 57008 fixed.  Made text changes.  I had to change "smoothing of
        jagged edges" to simply "smoothing of edges" though to get
        the Anti-aliasing (not Anti-alias) help to fit on a lo-res screen.
    o - 57010 & 55880 swapped.  I fixed 57010 last version.  The fix
        produced bug 55880,  which is worse.  (The Bernoulli does eventually
        time out.)   Soo,  I'm going back to the old way which will break
        57010 but fix 55880.
    o - 57012 NAB.  The supervga.drv it turns out causes some problems for
        some boards just being in the resource.    As a result we are
        de-emphasizing it a bit.  It's in the vesa subdirectory so that
        folks who read the readme or call product support will have
        access to it.   However it will not automatically be part of
        the package.
    o - 58883 NAB.  Just the way inks work in optics.
    o - Fixed a bug John reported to me where a rotated cel in Anim Cel
        would crash when you changed the key color.   Very glad he caught
        this as it would also show up as an erratic bug in a number of
        other places.  A 1 parameter to one of our low level routines
        ended up trashing about 64k of memory,  though any other value
        for this parameter was fine.   Anyway it's fixed now.
    o - 55825 NAB.  I couldn't reproduce this at all using the spacing.
        I think you meant leading.  At any rate this is by design.  The
        program is sensing that at a certain point one or more lines of
        text will not be visable,  and moves the ones that remain closer
        to the center.
    o - 55826 No Fix Likely.  This is a benign (non-crashing) condition
        which the user has to strain to reach.  
    o - 34932 I've done further tests on this.  It's pretty much rock solid
        on my machine.  These cordless tablets are susceptible to some RFI.
        I wonder if that's the problem.
    o - 92655 fixed (I think).  I changed the aspect ratio about 20% on
        the Wacom tablet driver.
    o - 55864 fixed.  F1 help disappears with a <return>
    o - 57011 Am using a version of run386b.exe (the bound-in DOS extender) that
        Network error appears when executing Ani.exe with 3COM loaded.
        Grant Blaha fetched me.  It looks like is of just slightly more recent
        vintage than the one we were using before.  Please see if this
        fixes the network problem.


PJ100
    Hmm, there was no 'rev 100.  I think maybe the build
    group called PJ99 100 (or was it just QA's bug list?).  Anyway on to 101!

PJ99
    o - TIFF writer in color mapped mode now puts out RGB components
        in range 0-64K (vs 0-256).  This fixes a bug Dan Silva reported
        to me.  (Your bug 55871)
    o - Fixed a bug in blockall.c that made .pfb fonts crash in
        build group versions.   It's possible this bug could have manifested
        as a memory leak when using .pfb fonts in the non-build-group
        versions. (Your bug #55874)
    o - Moved supervga.drv from resource directory into vesa directory.
    o - Changed way the program detects what devices are attatched on
        start up.   This should make it work better with the Bernoulli
        driver when the drive is turned off (but was booted with it on).
        In fact the program would *eventually* start before this change,
        but it took a minute or two.  (This minute or two has now been
        moved to when the user selects the Bernoulli drive button in the
        file requestor.  The Bernoulli device driver is way *slow* to time 
        out!) (57010)
    o - #55855 NAB. I looked at a couple of these Vector Arts fonts and they
        *aren't* Type1 format fonts by any stretch of the imagination.
        PJ95 is complaining about them with good cause.
    o - #55853 NAB.  I've looked into this fairly carefully.  What you're
        seeing is just rounding error which is inevitable at small
        point sizes.  At larger sizes they'll look rounder.
    o - #55841 NAB.  This is planned.  Old users are used to having the
        Copy button.  If it's not there they'll wonder how they can copy
        things.   The alert box tells them how.   True they might read
        the documentation,  but sadly odds are they won't.
    o - 55839 NAB.  An awkward feature though.  The first ESC gets out
        of the "string control".   This is more for compatibility with
        Animator (non-pro) than anything.   The second ESC quits the
        menu.   It works this way for any other menu where you are typing
        into a string control initially too: the file requestor,  the
        number requestor, etc.
    o - 55866 - Show'em Preview thing - I changed this last rev.  Don't
        think this report is relevant any more.
    o - 55868 - 2 Key equivalent for Two color works inside tools menu.
    o - 55869 NAB.  Postscript fonts do need the .pfb extension for me
        to tell what they are without taxing the user's patience.
    o - 55870 I believe David Ang has fixed the missing files in the
        install.  (Though we'll have to keep a sharp eye out for the
        new fonts when I get them.)
    o - 57005 NAB.  I'm not sure what you mean by this.  It does say
        "Press any key..." for the first slide of the preview.  I think
        the user would rather see the top of subsequent slides than have
        the instructions repeated.
    o - 57006 Fixed.   Nuked that bogus apostrophe.
    o - 57007 fixed/NAB.  I did change the naming a little bit last
        'rev.  Right now the general form is:
                5-letter-base-name  2-digit-slide-number  1-letter-line-number
        For instance if your batch file were named "bigboss.bat"  and
        you had 2 slides with 3 lines each show'em would create:
            bigbo00a.flc  bigbo00b.flc  bigbo00c.flc
            bigbo01a.flc  bigbo01b.flc  bigbo01c.flc
        In the case where the output is "stills" there is only one .flc
        for each file,  which does make the "a" at the end a little
        superfluous,  but otherwise I'm pretty happy with the naming
        convention.  It lets them have shows up to 100 slides long and
        with up to 25 lines plus the title in each slide.   
    o - 57008 fixed.  Minor text changes to Show'em.
    o - 57009 fixed/NAB.  The test tool will not show up in versions you
        get from the build group.  It's part of our "diagnostic" code
        I like to keep in for early testing.
    o - 55831 right justify off a few spaces to right fixed.
    o - 55867 I think I know what is going on,  but would like to have
        Canada.gif to double check.  Likely show'em is just temporarily
        coopting some colors to make the menus readable.  Please check
        if the black fringe is there during playback.
    o - 55873 fixed.  I reverted to the menu fonts for the release 1.0
        versions.  (The advantage of the others is they have European
        characters,  but we'll put off dealing with this until the
        Euro translation days.)
    o - Put new function "QmenuWithFlags" into Poco user interface library.
    o - Used "QmenuWithFlags" to put asterisks in appropriate places
        of Show'em Set Output Style menu to fix #55875.
    o - While I was at it used QmenuWithFlags to grey out sections of
        Create Slide Show menu in show'em if there's no text yet.
    o - 57000 fixed.  User is prompted to save the poco program if s/he's
        made changes.  

PJ98
SHOW'EM Changes:
    o - Many changes to show'em preview mode.    Took out query about
        "skip to next slide" and "abort preview".  Now <esc> just aborts.
        If user regrets this he can just preview again.  This effects #55817
        and 55852 and 55860.    Also scrolling and fading are reflected
        in the preview (#55865).
    o - #57002 is not a bug (NAB).  From the Ani perspective changes made by
        Poco count as changes.  Show'em indeed made 90 changes to the 
        flic.  Try cone.poc sometime....
    o - Show'em is now more intelligent about preventing you from overwriting
        a text file you've been working on.   If you've edited the text
        it will ask you if you want to save it before doing a "new" or
        "load".  This effects bug 57000.
    o - Show'em retains 5 letters (rather than 4) of the batch file name
        in constructing script and flic file names.
    o - Show'em asks about ALL the files it may overwrite.  (And it only
        took 4K of code!  Argh!)  #55820
    o - 55832 Output button is now Save button.  Also "Output to batch
        file?" header on file requestor changed to simply "Render slides?"
    o - 55842 show'em output cancel crash is gone.  (If you cancel the
        first one you simple cancel both.)
    o - Made a few changes to the code in response to #55849.
        Basically this is just a low memory situation,  and the program
        is going to report some sort of error.   I eliminated some of
        the multiple reporting.   However in general running at 800x600
        on a 4 meg machine is not a great idea.  640x480 works well in
        4 meg,  but for 800x600 you probably want a 6 meg machine to do
        memory intensive things such as Show'em and the Anim Cel/Sprite.
    o - 55850 - could the QA folks play with this some more?  Some of the
        changes I made in response to 55849 should make this better.  
        Also show'em releases the swap screen on exit,  which will get
        rid of that first 480K loss of memory you observe.
Other Changes:
    o - You can't use the root directory of a device as part of a temp
        path.   This helps alleviate bug #92656.
    o - Changed editor pageup/pagedown help as suggested in bug report 
        #55840.
    o - 55841 is not a bug (NAB).  This is for folks who upgrade but don't
        take the time to read the manual.   Otherwise they may well think
        they've lost a feature (the copy button on the move tool).
    o - 55848 NAB.  Sliders covering numbers larger than 200 are awkward
        to manipulate.   Almost all the time 200 will be large enough even
        in very high resolution screens.   If they *do* need a bigger font
        size then they can type it in.  (If I made the slider 600 effectively
        they'd *always* have to type it in.)
    o - 55862 NAB.  If you want to create a .cfg file,  just do
            ani -cfg xxx.cfg
        where xxx.cfg is the config file you want to create.  If you
        don't want to start from scratch do "copy aa.cfg xxx.cfg" first.
    o - 55837 fixed.  You can type file names with the name (as opposed to
        directory or extension) part longer than 8 characters without
        trashing the program stack (and crashing the program).
    o - 55839 NAB.  An awkward feature though.  The first ESC gets out
        of the "string control".   This is more for compatibility with
        Animator (non-pro) than anything.   The second ESC quits the
        menu.   It works this way for any other menu where you are typing
        into a string control initially too: the file requestor,  the
        number requestor, etc.
    o - 55863 - No Fix Likely.   We've some R&D going that might give us a way
        to fix this in a month or two.  At the moment we're telling people not
        to <ALT><TAB> under Windows except in lo-res 320x200 modes.

PJ97
    o - BMP driver handles bad data files better.  Had to work around a compiler
        bug on this one. (55708)
    o - Removed all compiled in debugging and diagnostic code.
    o - Set up for it to be built by the build group.  Found a few things
        missing from our backup cycle as a result.
    o - Changed all uses of 386asmp.exe to 386asm.exe so don't have to ship
        both assemblers to the build group.   (Also 386asm is faster
        in most cases.)
    o - '2', '1', and 'v' key equivs for two-color, one-color, and 
        render-under now work in the tools panel.

PJ96
    o - Made "one_color" do something in copy and move tools.
    o - Changed version number of program in "about" boxes from 1.0 to 1.3
    o - If there's no program yet, run, save, and save as options of
        poco/program menu are greyed out.  Program used to crash when you
        select "run" in this situation.
    o - Fixed bug where poco error reporting routine would dereference a
        NULL pointer if no source files open yet.   This was the cause of
        bug #55834
    o - 55713 I changed the prompt on numpic-Delete Numbered Pictures.
    o - Updated copyrights from 1991 to 1992.
    o - Moved the little blurb about aniplay into the resource file where it
        can be translated.
    o - Fixed 55714.  Old zoomed images not a problem with Numpic.  (Actually
        made function PicDirtied() update the zoom area which seems a broad
        solution to this problem here and elsewhere.)
    o - 55807 NAB.  It is fairly awkward to control a slider that covers too
        big of a range.   There are other parts in the program where you can
        type in numbers bigger than the slider goes because of this.  200 is
        definitely on the high side of what you want in normal use,  and for
        abnormal use you have to type it in.
    o - 55827 NAB.  You can type in to get smaller .pfb heights.  20 is the
        minimum that is going to look very good though,  which is reflected
        in the slider.
    o - 55828 changed.  Second button changed from OK to Cancel.
    o - Made small change to Type1 interpreter to let it not crash on 
        spaces in the baskrvll.pfb font one of the testers is using.
    o - 57004 'v' and '1' key equivalents are present in the Anim Cel panel.
    o - Removed an #ifndef/endif REXLIB_CODE from errcodes.h.  This
        bracketing removed all of 3 error codes from the client's side.
        Not worth the complexity.
    o - .PCT files without any bitmap information (such as the coreldrw.pct
        I got from Jon at QA) will report an error message rather than
        mysteriously changing the color map and nothing else. (55838)
    o - 55841 NAB.  This is for old users who don't read the manual.
SHOW-EM:
    o - Show'em doesn't report the # of unsaved changes,  only that there
        were.   This is in response to bug 57002.    Right now Poco routines
        update the change count as they are called,  which can be pretty often
        inside a program.   Thinking of Poco as a macro language this makes
        sense - a macro can perform many changes.   However at least in this
        case it's confusing....
    o - 55801 Multi-screen help comes with previous/next/done buttons.
    o - 55805 NAB.
    o - 55806 NAB.
    o - 55824 NAB.  The program is only doing what you ask it to.  (Which in
        this case is not very pretty.)
    o - Show'em will give up after ONE slide doesn't fit on disk.
        See if this effects bug 55846 please.   I can't really calculate
        the disk space without saving it.
    o - #55845 - When you bring up the Abort Preview? 
        requestor,  you no longer advance to the next frame if you
        answer "no".  
    o - 55817 Right click in preview does not abort, only escape.
    o - Show'em sample text doesn't show "safe titling" state.
    o - 55823 Fixed. Made show'em.poc put out "auto" parameter inside it's 
        batch files to avoid the little blurb saying aniplay is freely 
        distributable.
    o - Show'em during preview only puts up the "Any key or click to continue,
        <esc> to abort" message the first frame.
    o - 57003 "jif's" changed to "jiffies".
    o - 55843 - Changed show'em help to reflect that these have to be on
        their own line.
    o - 92747 - Poco SetSpeed problem - actually I fixed this as it was
        reported to me a couple of weeks ago.
    o - Show'em no longer save's GIF's, but instead saves single frame FLC's.
        These load faster avoiding an annoying delay during playback,  and
        also makes it so that bug #55836 can't happen.
    o - 55829 - The help in Show'em has been edited again by both Katherine
        and myself.  This looks like a place where be both disagree with
        you though.  Page two gives an overview,  page 3 the details.  It
        is nice to have both.

    o - Put *.DIB into BMP.PDR for real this time.
    o - New facility for shelling out to DOS.  This feature comes very late
        and with some limitations.  (I didn't think it could be done 
        economically but Ian surprised me.)  Still it looks useful enough to
        be a keeper.
            On the left most drop down menu near the bottom is now the
        selection "DOS Shell".   Choose it and you'll get an MS-DOS command
        prompt with [Ani] before it to remind you that you are shelled out.
            The shell normally only has 64K of memory to work with,  which 
        limits it pretty much to commands inside command.com and other very
        small programs.   However if you run Ani Pro from under Windows due to
        some virtual memory magic it will appear with approximately 450K free.
        (The exact amount will depend on your TSRs.  It will be just shy of
        100K less than you normally have according to the "mem" command.)
            If you're running under DOS you can make the shell have more
        memory to work with (at the expense of less memory for Ani) using
        the cfig386 program as follows:
            cfig386 ani.exe -maxreal FFFFh
        This will transfer about 450K of memory from Ani to the shell.


PJ94 
    o - Note the following bug fixes were encorporated in earlier versions
        but still are on the QA report.  I'm listing the version they were
        fixed in in paranthesis.   Please re-verify these bugs.
        35027(92), 35028(92), 35610(93), 41900(93), 55710(93 - forgot to
        document this), 
    o - There are a couple of bugs about the way PJ handles suffixes.
        We chose the way it works now,  and are not going to change it.
        Let me explain how it works now.
            When you are loading a file the suffix is not added automatically.
        Most of the time when you are loading a file you'll be selecting
        it from the file scroller.    MS-DOS does not require that files have
        extensions,  and some wildcards (.FL? for instance) could not be
        extensions.   For all these reasons we don't take the extension
        from the wild-card.   Please put #55712 into the Not A Bug (NAB)
        category.
            Similary #55709 is NAB.  The wildcard buttons just effect
        the file list,  not the file name.
    o - 55707 is another NAB.  In fact you can load .FLC files with
        the "load all" option.   At any rate at the level where the error
        is reported flics and pics are not distinguished.  I don't think
        the error message is misleading though it may not be as precise
        as it could be.
    o - #55802 - changed text for Load Background Image in Show'em.poc.
    o - #34932 the Wacom tablet one appears to be a hardware problem.
        We're checking for pointing device off tablet,  but apparently
        the signal isn't being generated correctly.
    o - #55706 is also NAB.  I half agree with you here,  but Peter decided
        picture format was something in the same category as display driver 
        and font directory,  not to be effected by a reset.
    o - #55813 is fixed.  In Show'em/background/Set Color doesn't 
        cause the background to be reloaded and possibly the query for
        load-first-frame.
    o - Made show'em.poc bullets like bullets.poc ones.  (A little
        larger, centered, and by default the same color as the item text.)
    o - 55815 is fixed.  I store the full font path,  though only the
        file name is displayed.  Hopefully won't be too bad on machines
        with fonts located in a different directory than where the .SSS
        was created since it checks the current font directory if it can't
        find the font in the directory in the SSS file.
    o - Animator & Windows:  we've done a couple of things to help Animator
        coexist with Windows.  This is still a delicate spot,  but here
        is a description of how the program works now:
            You can launch PJ94 from Windows without a PIF file,  and it will
        run fine in any resolution until you hit <alt><tab>,  at which
        point the screen will be all messed up,  and likely you'll have
        to reboot and maybe delete your Windows swap file.  (The problem
        is worse in hi-res than 320x200.  In 320x200 things will be
        pretty much OK for Windows,  but when you <alt><tab> back to 
        PJ93,   PJ's display will be a little messed up.)
            With a PIF file that has video/high-graphics checked you
        can <alt><tab> fine in 320x200 mode but hi-res modes will
        still have the same problems.  The PIF file should have
        the EMS memory and XMS memory set to 0 .. 0.  You can leave
        the DOS memory as is (128 .. 640).
            The problem with PJ gobbling all available virtual
        memory and causing much disk thrashing and so forth is fixed.
        Hopefully this will fix #55804.  (Though 4 megs is not really enough
        memory to run PJ under Windows well.  You can probably squeak by
        in lo-res if you don't have any ram-disks or anything.)
            Launching a full screen DOS box,  and then running PJ from
        it in lo-res seems to have no problems.


PJ93 (Released to Autodesk QA 8/19/92 backed up to Bernoulli)
    o - Video 7 and 8514/a display drivers don't show up on screen size
        list if the hardware isn't attatched.
    o - Fixed a little bug where two-color polygons and splines drawn with
        a fat brush in gradient inks would show some bogus colors near the
        edges.
    o - Fixed some more of bug #55809.  In Show'em.poc with an outline font
        the size doesn't grow by the leading each time you go to the font
        requestor.
    o - Fixed 35610 the off by one flisumry.poc bug.
    o - Changes in Poco according to Ian:
        > Fixed reporting of errors that occur in preprocessor
          statements.  It used to report a bogus line number.
          Changes in POCO.C, POCO.H, PP.C, CHOPPER.C.
          (Fixes bug #41900)
        > An unexpected '}' is now reported.  Changes in POCO.C.
        > Stack overflow is now checked on OP_ENTER so that
          allocating more local vars than we have stack space
          for is reported as an Err_poco_stack. Changes in RUNOPS.C.
        > Line number reporting on stack traceback is now correct
          when the error happens on or before the first line in
          the function.  Changes in TRACE.C.
        > Taking the address of an array by coding its name is
          now properly recognized as a legal constant init
          expression value. Changes in FOLD.C, POCO.C, VARINIT.C.
        > The pure_const status of an expression following an
          address-of (&) operator is now propogated upwards
          properly. (eg, &(*ptr) is no longer seen as pure_const).
          Changes in POCO.C.

PJ92 (Released to Autodesk QA 8/10/91) -
    o - Added new Poco function: "void   CelClipChanges(void);", 
    o - Added new Poco function:
        Boolean PhysicalMoveRubBox(int *x, int *y, int *width, int *height
        , Boolean clip_to_screen);
    o - Fixed bug where too small width parameter to WordWrap or
        WordWrapCountLines() will hang.
    o - Fixed bug where GetProgramDir() will crash.
    o - Fixed bug in SetSpeed() that made it max out at 8 jiffies.
    o - Fixed bug #35027 where joining a flic via a cut results in the
        2nd half of the join being corrupted if you preview first.
        (Involved changing a FALSE to a TRUE for keep_cel parameter to
        the second call to write_celframes in do_cut() in composit.c)
    o - Fixed bug #35028.  Added question marks at the end of some
        abort query boxes.
    o - Fixed bug #55704.  Loading itty bitty files (like .BSS files)
        no longer wigs out the PICT.PDR causing program to crash.
        (Fix was to check for short reads explicitly along with IO errors.
        fread() doesn't consider EOF an error,  but PICT.PDR was thinking
        it did I guess.)
    o - Fixed bug #55809 & 55810. Leading and spacing values don't get reset 
        every time you change the height of a PFB font.
    o - #55800 - added PFB button to wildcards on Select Any Font panel.

Jim - (Released to Autodesk QA as PJ 91 7/15/92.  Backed up to bernoulli 
      7/17/92)
    o - Finished implementing -mem parameter.
    o - Updated help message for
        convert ?
        aniplay ?

Jim - (Sent update to Ian 6/31/92 am. Backed up to bernoulli 7/1)
    o - Fixed bug where the translation table for small postage-stamps
        (less than 100x63) was 14 bytes short.   The effect of this
        bug was that small cels or flics containing any of colors 242-255
        would show up in the wrong color on the browse menu.
    o - Escape will (eventually) get you out of file selector again.
    o - HP Soft Fonts and Amiga fonts go through an ANSI-TO-OEM character
        translation table.  The effect of this is hopefully to make their
        international characters show up where the PC expects them to be.
    o - Added a -mem parameter that will control the maximum memory PJ will
        ask for.  This is all set up to accept input correctly, but currently
        will be ignored.
    o - Added a -flic parameter to load Flic on start up.  Also will load
        flic on startup if it is part of command line without a .poc 
        suffix.
    o - Rewrote help message when you type:
        ani ?
        ani -?
        ani /?

Jim - (Backed up to bernoulli 6/19/92)
    o - Changed cgroup to CGROUP in util\doserror.asm to get case sensitive
        High C linker to digest fliclib better.
    o - A few other dinky changes for Animator Support Library QA time.

Jim - (Released as PJ90 6/17/92)
    o - Fixed bug where .poe's wouldn't work with Ani Pro 1.0.

Jim - (Backed up to bernoulli 6/12/92)
    o - Made poco routine SetBlock() clip properly.
    o - Renames pj_put_rectpix to _pj_put_rectpix to indicate it does not
        clip.
    o - Added poco routines:
        "Screen  *GetPhysicalScreen(void);",
        "void    SetBox(Screen *s, int color, int x, int y, int width, int height);",
        "void   MenuText(Screen *screen, int color, int xoff, int yoff, char *text);
        "int    MenuTextWidth(char *text);",
        "int    MenuTextHeight(void);",
        "void   GetMenuColors(int *black, int *grey, int *light, int *bright, int *red);",
        "void PhysicalWaitClick(int *x, int *y, int *left, int *right, int *key);",
        "void PhysicalPollInput(int *x, int *y, int *left, int *right, int *key);",
        "void PhysicalWaitInput(int *x, int *y, int *left, int *right, int *key);",
        The intent of these is low level support for doing your own
        panels.  GetPhysicalScreen() returns the device driver 
        screen PJ uses for drawing menus as opposed to the flic.  
        SetBox sets a rectangular area to a solid color.   MenuText
        draws a string in the menu font.   PhysicalWaitClick() and related
        routines return the input in the PhysicalScreen coordinates.
    o - In palette/value/ramp if in HLS mode you'll get a rainbow'ish
        ramp instead of a flat one.
    o - Added a few more Poco routines still:
        "void   HLStoRGB(int h, int l, int s, int *r, int *g, int *b);",
        "void   RGBtoHLS(int r, int g, int b, int *h, int *l, int *s);",
        "int    ClosestColorInScreen(Screen *s, int r, int g, int b);",
        "ErrCode    SqueezeColors(int *source_map, int source_count, int *dest_map, int dest_count);"
        "ErrCode    FitScreenToColorMap(Screen *s, int *new_colors, Boolean keep_key);",
    o - Integrated a lot of Ian's Poco bug fixes.


Jim (6/4/92 backed up to bernoulli)
    o - Fixed a few spelling mistakes in bullet.poc
    o - Added some help on the F1 key (and moved pick up color to F2).
        There are 3 different help systems now.  From the home
        panel F1 will give you a list of key equivalents.  When
        editing a poco program F1 will bring up the "lookup.poc"
        program providing a list of library functions.  In other
        text editors F1 will provide a screen of help on the text
        editor.
    o - Added a few more key equivalents:
        d - toggle dither.
        k - toggle clear key color.
        v - toggle render cel over/under
        1 - toggle render cel in 1 color
        2 - toggle draw polygons in 2 colors
    o - Separated move tool into move tool and copy tool.
    o - Changed "xor" to "unzag" as one of the default inks.

Jim (6/3/92 PJ 89 released to Autodesk for alpha testing and
    backed up to Bernoulli)
    o - Made "bullet.poc", which is intended to replace "mshow.poc".
    o - Added color cluster access routines to Poco:
        "void    SetCluster(int cluster_size, int *cluster);",
        "ErrCode GetCluster(int *cluster_size, int **cluster);",
    o - Added some more font metric routines to Poco:
        "void SetFontSpacing(int spacing);",
        "int GetFontSpacing(void);",
        "void SetFontLeading(int leadint);",
        "int GetFontLeading(void);",
        "int   WordWrapCountLines(int width, char *text);",

Jim (5/30/92 eve Backed up to Bernoulli)
    o - Fixed flex problems with Type1 fonts.  Now Palintino fonts
        are all ok, and letter forms seem to be fine in every font
        I have.  Maybe 10% of the PD fonts seem to have some
        problems with inter-letter spacing though.
    o - Made edge tool use current brush rather than always be 1 pixel
        wide.
    o - Put Type1 fonts so they draw via a cached bitmap again.  Looks
        like they all work.  Think this is a good place to ship our
        PS Type1 fonts.
    o - Added bmp into backup cycle.  Removed obsolet publib from
        backup cycle.

Jim (5/29/92 am  Backed up to Bernoulli)
    o - Some more type1 font dinking.  Found a place where it could
        close the letter without closing the shape with disasterous
        results (crashing fill_on_off) and fixed it.  Now all fonts
        I have load ok.  However a few, including the Palintino Roman
        (por_____.pfb) draw sort of funky.  It seems to be related
        to the "flex" stuff in type1.c.
    o - Integrated some of Ian's fixes to Poco (not ones downloaded
        5/28 though).
    o - Made file requestor respond a bit more like Windows one.
        If you type a wildcard or a directory into the "filename" area, 
        it will update the scrolling list of files and other fields.
        If you type in a full path name it will use it
        (ignoring the directory listed below).
    o - Split Pocosrc.inc into pocosrc.inc and poesrc.inc

Jim (5/21/92 Sent off update to Ian) -
    o - Made \paa\flic386p\3dlook which contains some code for
        Carroll Lastinger.
    o - A few changes to fliclib.

Jim (5/20/92am backed up to Bernoulli) - 
    o - Finished implementing and testing Poco Tween library.
        Have testtitl.poc and testtwee.poc that give the
        titling and tween library the once over.
    o - Back in the type1 font stuff making it so that font 
        renders into a bitmap first,  and then blits the bitmap.
        I keep the bitmap around until the font is unloaded or
        resized.  (It's a caching scheme.)  Alas there are 
        some bugs yet.  In particular the font bounding box is
        sometimes off by one leading to problems....
    o - Hmm, really having to futz with the Type1 stuff.  I downloaded
        about 20 .PFB's from BIX,  but only about 1 in 4 would read.
        It ended up that the line-oriented parsing of the type1 code
        I got from Autodesk didn't work for these because they'd sometimes
        have two or more definitions on a line (separated by white space.)
        I redid things with a little tokenizer and they seem to mostly
        work now.  However the archetect font still has a problem
        with the letter H.   Anyway been working 6 hours real solid today
        and futzing for the last couple on it.  Time to back up!

Jim - (5/13/92 am backed up to Bernoulli)
    o - Adding new Poco Tween library:
        ErrCode TweenLoad(char *file_name);
        ErrCode TweenSave(char *file_name);
        Boolean TweenExists(void);
        void    TweenClear(void);
u       ErrCode TweenSetStart(int ptcount, int *x, int *y);
u       ErrCode TweenGetStart(int *ptcount, int **x, int **y);
u       ErrCode TweenSetEnd(int ptcount, int *x, int *y);
u       ErrCode TweenGetEnd(int *ptcount, int **x, int **y);
u       void    TweenSwapEnds(void);
u       ErrCode TweenEndToStart(void);
        ErrCode TweenOneLink(int start_point, int end_point);
u       Errcode TweenSetLinks(int link_count, int *starts, int *ends);
u       Errcode TweenGetLinks(int *link_count, int **starts, int **ends);
        ErrCode TweenClearLinks(void);
        void    TweenSetSplined(Boolean is_splined);
        Boolean TweenGetSplined(void);
        ErrCode TweenTrails(void);
        ErrCode TweenMakePoly(double time, int *ptcount, int **x, int **y);
        ErrCode TweenRender(void);
        (The ones marked u are still unimplemented)
    o - Wrote up tweenlib.doc and titlelib.doc.  Just started pocotut.doc
        in WinWord format.
    o - Made it so that if the program doesn't have enough memory on
        startup it displays a suggestion about how to aquire more
        free extended more memory instead of the 3 language can't
        find resource file message.   
        It would be good to get this message:
"Not enough free extended memory to run program.  Some ways to increase\n"
"the extended memory available are:\n"
"   Remove RAM disks (VDISK and RAMDRIVE) from config.sys.\n"
"   Reduce size of RAM disks (see DOS or Windows manuals).\n"
"   Remove or reduce size of EMM emulators from config.sys.\n"
"   Reduce size of disk caches such as SMARTDRV.SYS.\n"
"   Install more RAM.\n";
        or at least the first part translated into French and German too.


Jim - (5/11 am backed up to Bernoulli)
    o - Made text editor load arbitrary sized files.   It only lets
        you add 16K more characters at any given session,  but the
        16K total limit is now gone.
    o - Adding Qedit() and QeditFile() to User library in Poco.
    o - Added new Poco Titling library with
        "void   TitleSetJustify(int just);",
        "int    TitleGetJustify(void);",
        "void   TitleSetMovement(int movement);",
        "int    TitleGetMovement(void);",
        "void   TitleSetScrolling(int scrolling);",
        "int    TitleGetScrolling(void);",
        "ErrCode    TitleSetText(char *text);",
        "ErrCode    TitleSetTextFromFile(char *file_name);",
        "char   *TitleGetText(void);",

Jim - (5/7 sent source update to Ian and 5/8 executable to Bob as pj88)
    o - Added CanScaleFont() and ScaleFont() to Poco. (Bumped Poco
        version to 180)
    o - Fixed a few details so that the font size is 
        kept between invokations of PJ and of the font requestor.
        (The initial size of a scalable font will be whatever size
        the last font was.)

Jim (5/2/92 am Backed up to Bernoulli)
    o - Font requestor now has a "height" button,  which you can set
        for PS Type 1 fonts.
    o - Changed text editor a bit to handle undrawing of characters
        that might extend to the left or right of where it thinks
        they should (ie slanted italic characters and the like).
    o - Type1 fonts a pretty much full PJ vfonts now.  Just need a little
        more testing and some polishing of the "height" button in the
        font requestor.

Jim (5/1/92 am Backed up to Bernoulli)
    o - Changed last parameter of gftext() from a blit function to
        a mode (so that can have polygon based text).  Put
        TM_MASK1, TM_MASK2, TM_RENDER mode definitions in rastext.h.
    o - Work on bringing Type1 fonts into PJ vfont system.  

Jim (4/29/92)
    (Backed up to Bernoulli.  Sent off to Ian.  Crc file in ianlast.crc.)
    o - Some minor changes to PoeKit.  Added __8087 to rexlib\math.lib
        for compatibility with Watcom 8.5 and 9.0.  Ian fixed bug in
        poekit\colorutl\ClosestColors.
    o - Starting to hack in Adobe Type1 Font stuff.  Right now only
        exists in outline (not filled) form in test().
    o - Fixed bug where Poco Circle() routine would lose a bit of memory
        in exotic inks.  (Was missing free_render_cashe()/make_render_cashe()
        in po_ink_circle().)
    o - pj_zalloc() wasn't clearing the last byte in odd-sized requests!
    o - Moved fixed point code out of spline.c and into util\fixpoint.c
        and inc\fixpoint.h
    o - Moved set_bit_hline() out of flood.c and into gfx\bithline.c
    o - Added new util\blockall.c 
    o - Tweaked gfx\pgconcave.c a bit so that font\type1.c could share
        some routines.
    o - Type1 fonts render filled,  but still not hacked in as fonts
        (just in test()).

Jim (4/17/92) (Backed up to Bernoulli)
    o - Changed include files a little to make them correspond better with
        the documentation of the PoeKit.
    o - Changed picdrive/tiff/makefile so that it didn't force 
        tiff.c recompilation twice every make.
    o - Added directory - /paa/font/ps1 - for Post Script type 1 source
        John Walker found on the net.  It's in the back-up cycle,  but
        doesn't get linked in yet.  

Jim -
    o - Worked around compiler bug that was causing the line:
            brd.dst = OPTR(chunk,(sizeof(chunk)+256));
        in fli\flipstam.c to be interpreted as
            brd.dst = sizeof(chunk)+256;
        Just a case of the optimizer slipping a stitch and forgetting what's
        in eax.  Fixed it by moving this line up a couple of lines.
        (Took a while to find though!)
    o - Fixed bug in Convert where in scaling down to 320x200 it would
        create a flc format file with a .fli suffix when you said you
        wanted old style.
    o - Changed exit(0); in main() routine of \paa\rexlib\rexhost\rexdump.c
        to return(0);  Somehow exit(0); causes make to think it it's 
        terminating with an error code and hence (indirectly) it isn't
        possible to make widget.lib.   Fixed now though.
    o - Changed "thecel" to "fc" on lines 94&95 of \paa\flicelio.c to
        fix join-with-GIF crash (34026).
    o - Added "?" to end of abort join dialog box.  (35609).

Jim (1/24/92) - Backed up to Bernoulli
    o - Reworked code to compile under Watcom 8.5.  Most of the work was
        dealing with 8.5's stricter type checking of function pointers.
        Heavy edit to rastlib.h to put in typedefs for all library
        functions and scattered casting to these types throughout PJ
        (but especially in rastlib directory and picdrive.)
        Done some light testing, and seems to still work miraculously
        enough!
    o - Reworked makefiles so that wlink is used everywhere instead
        of wlink here and fastlink there.
    o - NOTE: widget directory still doesn't compile.  
    o - NOTE: Still need to change \build directory for new Watcom.

Ian - 
    o - Bunch of junk mostly to flic386p (flic lib)
    o - Sent back to Jim who's computer died.

Jim - (Sent off to Ian as PJ87)
    o - Added pj_get_default_cmap to flic-lib, and had to add pj_ to
        places that were calling it.
    o - Folded the very small \paa\initcmap.c file into palet2.c and
        moved it's comment to \paa\pjhigh\initcmap.c where it was
        relevant.  (I don't really like having files with the same
        names in different directories.)
    o - Moved palette load/save from palet2.c to pjhigh/colsave.c and 
        colload.c.  Made it so will load old (AA) .COL files.  Prepared
        for putting pj_cmap_load/save into fliclib.

Ian -
    o - Added pj_ to the front of a couple more routines that're destined
        for the fliclib.

Jim -
    o - #ifdef'd out all the String stuff from Poco (#ifdef STRING_EXPERIMENT)

Jim - (PJ86 - Backed up to Bernoulli at Dancing Flame)
    o - Started hacking String's into Poco.  Also fixed a few Poco bugs
        including some problems with void valued expressions.
    o - Have some Poco programs ported from my old Pogo simulations
        and games including Warblers and eco.  Eco is a big old
        .POE module too.

Ian -
    o - Added pj_ to the front of a couple of routines that're destined
        for the fliclib.

Peter (Source sent to Ian as PJ 85.  This was the first publicly released
        version - Autodesk Animator Pro 1.00)
    o - removed xor_from_ram in vesa\device.c since this call failed the
        torture test.  Because of the way this call is used by PJ there will
        not be any errors in the operation of PJ, but the driver doesn't
        match the spec and may fail to do what some other program wants. 
        Also this call is so infrequent in PJ that there will be no significant
        difference without it.
    o - Fixed call for ferror as provided to drivers in lstdio so I could
        re make the torture program.  This was needed so Jbyers could have
        a current version of turture for the driver kit.
