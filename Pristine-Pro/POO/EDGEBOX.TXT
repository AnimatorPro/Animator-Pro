Installation
************

Copy the EDGEBOX.POC file to your \ANI\RESOURCE directory.
Now when you start ANI go to the POCO pull down menu and select EDGEBOX.

Directions for use...
*********************
A. Select the outer edge of the area you want to EDGEBOX.

   A box will now be drawn on the screen to give you a reference to
   place the inner edge of the EDGEBOX. (The box is drawn using the
   current color.  If you can not see the box, select a different color.)

                            *** IMPORTANT!!! ***
   The swap buffer will be replaced with a snap shot of the current
   screen.  Make sure to save any image in the swap buffer that you
   want to keep!!!

B. Select the inner edge of the EDGEBOX.

C. Select a lightsource.

   As a rule of thumb...
   If you want the object to appear to 'stick out', choose the UPPER LEFT.
   If you want the object to appear to 'stick in', choose the LOWER RIGHT.

E. Select an intensity.

   You may need to change this number depending on the current palette
   you are working with.

How it works...
***************

After selecting your outer and inner edges, lightsource and intensity,
EDGEBOX will then highlight the 'light' areas with the 'BRIGHT' ink
using the intensity value as the value for that ink.  The dark areas
work the same way with the 'DARK' ink.

You can register EDGEBOX for only $15.00.

Why is it important to register???

Writing these utilities takes time.  Time is money.  If I know that
you like the utilities enough to register them, I am going to make
more improvements and features, as well as new utilities.
