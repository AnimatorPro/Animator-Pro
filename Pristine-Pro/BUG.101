55883  1 On IBM Model 95 running XGA and using the vanilla 320x200 driver,
         user has to boot ANIPRO 3 times to get it to launch.

         This problem was originally reported through Compuserve and 
         confirmed with Jake Richter of Panaces (jaker on email)

         Setup:  IBM Model 95 with XGA

         1.  Del config file
         2.  Launch AniPro - should get abnormal termination
         3.  Launch AniPro - should get abnormal termination and kicked 
             into 40 character mode
         4.  Launch AniPro - this time it should launch correctly.

         Jake was able to run AniPro using the Panacea drivers.  
         However, if he attempted to switch from HighRes to 320
         x200 AniPro returned an abnormal termination.

55884  2 In Show'em the size of the bullets are calculated using the 
         Leading value, not the Height.

         1.  Load Show'em
         2.  Select Set SLide Style, then Items
         3.  Select Item Font
         4.  Set Leading to 150 and click Load - note size of bullets
         5.  Set Leading to 50 and click load

         Bug:  Bullets are now much smaller.  Size of bullets should be 
         locked to the size of the font, not the leading value.

92655  2 DIGITIZER: Aspect ratio of driver is incorrect for Wacom 420E and
         510.

         PROCEDURE:
         Connect and configure for a Wacom tablet using AApro's 
         supplied Wacom driver, WACOM.IDR.  Next, enter AAPro and, 
         using a draw tool and the digitizer's stylus, trace around a 
         round object.  The resulting image in AAPro is an ellipsoid 
         instead of a circle.
