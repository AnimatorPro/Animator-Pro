Yost Group,

This Zip has the FLC GOODBAD.FLC in it.  If you crank up Animator Pro and save 
each frame (from the PIC menu or from NUMPIC) the first frame produces an 
apparently good GIF, the second frame produces a bad gif.  "Bad Gif" means that 
some GIF viewers won't display it, some lock up on it, some (PICLAB) report
"Multimage GIF with multimage flag set to false".  The problem is down about 
line 450 - per PICLAB.

If you save the frames as TGA or PCX you won't see this problem.

Phil Shatz (CIS buddy, Ani Pro and GRASP user) says he has seen the same thing.  
He works around it by changing a single pixel in the offending frame.  That 
cures it for him.

I've been doing some 256 color to 16 color conversions - about a thousand 
frames.  This only happened twice.

Thank you for Ani Pro and your help.
