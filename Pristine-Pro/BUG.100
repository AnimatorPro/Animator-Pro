Number    Problem Description
======    =================================================================

 34932  2 9/3/92, PJ94:  According to Jim Kent, the Wacom tablet problem 
          appears to be a hardware one.  He's checking for pointing device 
          off tablet, but apparently the signal isn't being generated 
          correctly.
          
          -----------------------------------------------------------------
          
          When using the Wacom tablet, the cursor appears in unwanted 
          locations with no command from the input device.
          
          1.  Set the stylus or puck off of the tablet, with the cursor in 
          the center of the Tween screen (with Shape/Poly selected).
          2.  After several minutes a line will appear from the cursor to 
          another unselected point.
          
          This occurs with both the Compaq and PS2/70.
          
 52150  2 Brush size shows size 1, in Brush menu, it says size 5.   
 NAB
          
          PROCEDURE:
          
          1.  Look at Brush Icon on Home Panel.  It shows the brush size
              at #1.
          2.  Right click on the Brush Icon and the Brush Menu appears.
          3.  Look at the brush size in the Brush Menu.
          
              It will show size 5 even though the brush icon in the Home
              Panel shows brush size of 1.

 55825  3 Sample text doesn`t accurately display when spacing value is 
 NAB
          changed.
          
          1.  Open the Fonts panel
          2.  Select the ARCHITXT.PFB font
          3.  Set Height to 40
          4.  Open the Spacing dlog and gradually increase the spacing 
          
          Bug:  As spacing increases, the top sample line moves up.  When 
          spacing reaches 35 or so, the top line jumps down and then moves 
          up again until spacing reaches 109 or so when the top line jumps 
          to the middle of the box.  

 55826  2 Maximum leading value gets confused when Height is changed.
 NFL
          
          1.  Load ARCHITXT.PFB and set height to 20
          2.  CHange Spacing to maximum value (should be 100)
          3.  Change Height to 100
          4.  Change Spacing to maximum (495)
          5.  Change Height back to 20
          
          Bug:  Leading is still set to 495. If I open the Leading field, 
          don't change anything, then click OK, I get an error message.

          up the low memory alert.  Shouldn't cancel put the user back 
          where he started?

          3.  Type V to toggle Render Over/Under

          Same problem with One Color.  Typing 1 only toggles if the menu

 NAB

          3)  Open another Picture file without saving the changes
              to the first one.
              The program does this without asking if you want to
              save changes.
          
          4)  Repeat the first 3 steps using FLC files.
              If you try to open a new flic after modifying the current
              flic, you get a message saying "You have <#> unsaved
              changes to your flic.  Save changes?"
          
          The program should give the same warning for a Picture as it
          does for a Flic file.

 57010  1 Reported from a beta site:
 NFL
          
          A crash occurs when booting up Ani Pro and not all devices are 
          turned on.  
          
          When booting up, the software looks for all devices--if those 
          devices are NOT TURNED ON, it crashes.  For example, if the 
          bernoulli drives are off, the program will crash.

 57011  2 Network error appears when executing Ani.exe with 3COM loaded.
 ?fixed?
 pending Grant
          
          Using a Compaq with 3COM loaded, the following message appears 
          when typing ANI from the PJ98 directory:
          
               NET803: Network path not found.
               Abort, Retry, Fail?
          
          When selecting Abort, the system goes back to the DOS prompt.  
          When selecting Retry, the same message is displayed.  When 
          selecting Fail, Ani Pro 1.3 does come up and work correctly.  It 
          seems like something in the code is conflicting with the network.
          This also happens when executing both Aniplay and Convert.

 57012  2 Supervga.drv isn't recognized from the VESA subdirectory.   
 NAB
          
          When I do a reset to change the screen resolution (or select 
          Screen Size from the Extra menu), I don't get the hi-res choices 
          of resolution.
          
          After I copy Supervga.drv to the \Resource directory, it works 
          fine.

 58867  2 The PosterHo.pfb font on the CD won't load.
 FONT
          
          1.  Load the PosterHo.pfb font from the AniPro 1.3 CD
          
          Bug:  Alert:  No charstrings.

 58883  2 In Optics, when I apply an effect to a gradient object the 
 NAB
          gradient colors shift.
          
          1.  Create a new flic with 50 frames
          2.  Draw a box using one of the gradient inks
          3.  Open Optics and select Twirl from the Presets Menu
          4.  Click Use then render the flic
          5.  Replay the flic
          
          Bug:  The gradient colors are changed.
          
          If I create two objects, one using the full color gradient, the 
          other using the greyscale gradient, when rendered both objects 
          show a greyscale gradient.

 92655  2 DIGITIZER: Aspect ratio of driver is incorrect for Wacom 420E and 
 fixed
          510.
          
          PROCEDURE:
          Connect and configure for a Wacom tablet using AApro's supplied Wacom
          driver, WACOM.IDR.  Next, enter AAPro and, using a draw tool and the 
          digitizer's stylus, trace around a round object.  The resulting image
          in AAPro is an ellipsoid instead of a circle.
